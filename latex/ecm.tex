\begin{acknowledgement}{Acknowledgements}{}{Acknowledgements}{}{}{g:acknowledgement:idp403330828320}
This book is a synthesis of three textbooks on discrete mathematics and combinatorics.  First, many of the problems, and indeed entire sections, come directly from \textsl{Combinatorics Through Guided Discovery} by Kenneth P. Bogart.  This is possible thanks to the Bogart estate's decision to release his book under an open license (the GFDL, the same license this text uses).  The format of this book has been made to match that of Bogart's text, with most of the exposition being driven by problems (which we call \emph{activities}) for students to work on.  A copy of Bogart's book can be found for free at \href{http://bogart.openmathbooks.org/}{bogart.openmathbooks.org}.%
\par
The second source for material is \textsl{Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics} by Richard Grassl and Tabitha Mingus.  This is a set of notes used for many years as the textbook for MATH 528 at the University of Northern Colorado.  We have tried to capture the flavor and emphasis of this book, and have used many of its exercises among our \emph{activities}.%
\par
For the background material contained in the index, as well as much of the chapter on graph theory, material was borrowed from \textsl{Discrete Mathematics: an Open Introduction}, the book I wrote for the undergraduate discrete course at the University of Northern Colorado.  This book can be found (for free) at \href{http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/}{discrete.openmathbooks.org}.%
\par
Finally, thanks to Ricardo Diaz for his helpful suggestions while compiling this book.  And thanks in advance to all the students who will soon be contacting me with suggestions for improvements.%

\begin{preface}{Preface}{}{Preface}{}{}{x:preface:preface}
This book was written specifically to be used as the textbook for the Master's level Discrete Mathematics course at the University of Northern Colorado.  This course is part of a MA in Mathematics with a Teaching Emphasis.  Most of the students in the course are current secondary math teachers.  This intended audience has influenced the style and content of the book in a few important ways.%
\par
First, we acknowledge that not everyone reading this book will be immediately familiar with the content of a standard undergraduate discrete mathematics course.  Little is assumed about the reader's previous work in the subject, beyond a general understanding of how abstract mathematics proceeds, as well as some basic ability with mathematical proof.  For the reader completely unfamiliar with these and the basic objects of mathematical study (sets and functions), background material is included in an Appendix.%

Topics have been selected to illustrate larger concepts of interest to secondary teachers.  We have put an emphasis on understanding simple concepts deeply and in more than one way.  Although some topics intersect secondary curriculum, most of the questions here are at a higher level.  Still, the problem solving strategies and big ideas illustrated by our questions have applications to secondary mathematics.  This emphasis is quite different than other mid level discrete and combinatorics textbooks, since we are not preparing our readers to begin a career in research mathematics.%
\par
While this course is not a course on teaching mathematics, we have tried to model good pedagogical practice.  As you will see, almost all of the textbook consists of \emph{Activities} and \emph{Exercises} that guide students to discover mathematics for themselves.  This will require quite a bit more work both from students and instructors, but we strongly believe that the best way to learn mathematics is by doing mathematics.  Most of all, discovering mathematics is fun.%
\begin{paragraphs}{How to use this book.}{g:paragraphs:idp403331045952}%
This book is mostly about solving problems, and using those problems and their solutions to develop mathematics and mathematical understanding.  The main three chapters consist of more than 300 \emph{activities} and \emph{exercises} which the reader is asked to complete.  That is how you should use the book.  As you read, when you come to an activity, really take some time to try to solve it.  Many of the activities are broken down into tasks to help guide you to a solution.  If you get stuck, check for a hint.  In the pdf, problems with hints are marked with a small ``[hint]'' link that will take you to the hint in the back of the book; clicking on the number of the hint will return you to the activity.  The online version has expandable hint links under any activities for which they are provided.%
\par
The exercises are similar to activities, but can be thought of as optional.  In particular, it is less important that you complete the exercise immediately, as they are not used to motivate the next part of the text.  Some of the exercises allow you to deepen your understanding of a topic; others are just for practice.%
\par
Solutions are not provided explicitly, but often the important content of an activity will be explained further into the book.  We have made every effort to make the problems ``self checking'' so that you do not run the risk of learning something false.%
\par
For the most part, if you are unable to complete an activity, assuming you have put a reasonable effort in already, it would be safe to move on.  If the activity is meant to guide you to a fundamental concept, that will become apparent, and later activities and exposition will help you uncover that concept.  Other activities are meant to provide interesting examples of these big ideas, but missing any one of them will not impede your progress on other activities.%

\begin{introduction}{}%
One of the first things you learn in mathematics is how to count. Now we want to count large collections of things quickly and precisely. For example:%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}In a group of 10 people, if everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once, how many handshakes took place?%
\item{}How many ways can you distribute \(10\) girl scout cookies to \(7\) boy scouts?%
\item{}How many anagrams are there of ``anagram''?%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
Before tackling questions like these, let's look at the basics of counting.%

Let's start our investigation of combinatorics by examining Pascal's Triangle.  If you are already familiar with this mathematical object, try to see it with fresh eyes.  Look at the triangle as if you have no idea where it comes from.  What do you notice?%

\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403331135648}%
Treating Pascal's Triangle as nothing more than a triangular array of numbers, what do you notice about it?  Are there any patterns to the numbers? Try to find some patterns and then see if you can answer (or have already answered) the following:%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}How are the entries in the triangle found?  What would the next row down be?%
\item{}What is the sum of the entries in the \(n\)th row?%
\item{}What is \(1 - 5 + 10 - 10 + 5 - 1\)?  What pattern is this an example of, and does it always work?%
\item{}What is \(1 + 3 + 6 + 10 + 15\)?  What pattern is this an example of, and does it always work?%
\item{}What is \(1+ 7 + 15 + 10 + 1\)?  What pattern is this an example of, and does it always work?%
\item{}Are there any groups of numbers in the triangle that are particularly recognizable?%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
We would like to understand why the patterns you discovered above exist, and to prove that they really do exist everywhere in the triangle.  There are at least two ways we can proceed (and we will try to proceed in both ways to maximize our understanding).  First, we can use notation to describe the entries in the triangle, provide a definition for what each entry is, and prove our results entirely based on these definitions.  Second, we can ascribe some \emph{meaning} to the entries in the triangle, saying what the numbers represent, and then make arguments about those representations.%
\par
 The advantage to pursuing both these approaches is that doing so creates a feedback loop.  A fact we establish using pure symbolic manipulation allows us to conclude something about the real world and what these numbers represent.  That helps us understand the applications better, which in turn might help us make arguments about those applications, which can then establish a purely symbolic fact about the triangle.%
\par
Let's pause and just for fun consider a few discrete math questions that probably have nothing to do with Pascal's Triangle or each other.  Probably.%
\begin{activity}{}{x:activity:act-latticepaths}%
The \terminology{integer lattice} is the set of all points in the Cartesian plane for which both the \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates are integers.%
\par
A \terminology{lattice path}\index{lattice path} is one of the shortest possible paths connecting two points on the lattice, moving only horizontally and vertically. For example, here are three possible lattice paths from the points \((0,0)\) to \((3,2)\):%

Recall that a \terminology{subset} \(A\) of a set \(B\) is a set all of whose elements are also elements of \(B\); we write \(A \subseteq B\).  For example, some of the subsets of \(B = \{1,2,3,4,5\}\) are \(\{2,4,5\}\), \(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\) and \(\emptyset\).  Recall also that the \terminology{cardinality} of a set is simply the number of elements in it.%
\par
Since we will often consider sets of the form \(\{1,2,3,\ldots,n\}\), let's adopt the notation \([n]\) for this set.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}Write out all subsets of \([3] = \{1,2,3\}\).  Then group the subsets by cardinality.  How many subsets have cardinality 0?  How many have cardinality 1?  2? 3?%
\item{}Write out all subsets of \([4]\), and determine how many have each possible cardinality.%
\item{}How many subsets of \([5]\) are there of each cardinality?  Try to answer this questions without writing out all 32 subsets.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403331884000}%
Some definitions: A \terminology{bit} is either 0 or 1 (bit is short for ``binary digit'').  Thus a \terminology{bit string} is a string of bits.  The \terminology{length} of a bit string is the number of bits in the string; the \terminology{weight} of a bit string is the number of 1's in the string (or equivalently, the sum of the bits). A \terminology{\(n\)-bit string} means a bit string of length \(n\).%
\par
We will write \(\B^n_k\) to mean the set of all \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\).  So for example, some of the elements in \(\B^5_3\) are,%
\begin{equation*}
11100 \qquad 10101 \qquad 01101.
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}Write out all \(3\)-bit strings.  Group these by weight.  How many strings are there of each weight?%
\item{}Write out all \(4\)-bit strings.  You might want to use the list you had in the previous part as a starting point (how would you do this?).  Again, group these strings by weight and see how many there are of each type.%
\item{}How many \(5\)-bit strings of weight 3 are there?  List all of these, and say how they relate to some of the \(4\)-bit strings you found above.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
We are not quite ready to consider the algebraic approach yet, but here is a fun algebra exercise.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403331957040}%
Multiply out (and collect like terms): \((x+y)^3\).  Repeat for \((x+y)^4\) and \((x+y)^5\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}What is the coefficient of \(x^3y^2\) in the expansion of \((x+y)^5\)?%
\item{}What are the coefficients of \(x^2y^2\) and \(x^3y\) in the expansion of \((x+y)^4\)?  How does this relate to the previous question?  Why does this make sense?%
\item{}If you believe the connection between coefficients and Pascal's triangle you have discovered above, find the coefficient of \(x^7y^4\) in the expansion of \((x+y)^{11}\) using Pascal's triangle.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
Hopefully by now you have some questions that are begging to be answered.  Here are two that we will focus on specifically:%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}Why are the answers to all the counting questions above the same as each other?%
\item{}Why are the answers to all the counting questions above numbers in Pascal's triangle?%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par
We could answer the first question by answering the second: if we can say why each answer is a particular entry in Pascal's triangle, then we know two answers will be equal because they are in the same place on the triangle.  But we can do better.  In fact, we should be able to explain why these counting questions correspond to each other without knowing \emph{any} of the answers.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403328349376}%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}Explain why the number of lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((k,n-k)\) is the same as number of \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\). You do not need to give a formal proof here, just explain the idea.%
\item{}Explain why the number of \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\) is the same as the number of \(k\)-element subsets of \([n] = \{1,2,3,\ldots, n\}\).   Again, an informal argument is fine.%
\item{}Explain why the number of \(k\)-element subsets of \([n]\) is the same as the coefficient of \(x^ky^{n-k}\) in the expansion of \((x+y)^n\).%

Are you satisfied with the explanations you gave above?  Do you think they would count as a formal mathematical proof that the counting questions have the same answer?  One way to make this sort of an argument more precise is to involve precisely defined mathematical objects.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403329473840}%
Consider functions \(f:X \to Y\) where \(X\) and \(Y\) are finite sets.  In fact, let's say \(X = [4]\). If you need a refresher on basic ideas about functions, check out \hyperref[x:section:sec_background-functions]{Section~\ref{x:section:sec_background-functions}}.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}Can you say anything at all about \(Y\) if you know there is some function \(f:X \to Y\)?  Give some examples of sets \(Y\) and functions \(f\).%
\item{}What if \(f:X \to Y\) is \emph{injective} (in other words, one-to-one)?  Which of the examples you found above no longer work?  What can you conclude about \(Y\)?%
\item{}What if \(f:X \to Y\) is \emph{surjective} (i.e., onto)?  Now what can you say about \(Y\)?%
\item{}What if \(f:X\to Y\) is \emph{bijective} (so both injective and surjective)?  State the general principle.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
The previous activity was meant to help you discover what is usually called the \terminology{bijection principle}: \emph{Two sets \(X\) and \(Y\) have the same cardinality if and only if there is a bijection \(f:X \to Y\)}.%
\par
If you want to prove that two sets have the same number of elements, all that is required is to define a function from one set to the other, and prove that the function is a bijection.  For us, those two sets will be the set of outcomes we are counting.  So for example, we can show that the \emph{set} of \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\) has the same cardinality as the \emph{set} of \(k\)-element subsets of \([n]\).  This will prove that the counting questions, ``how many \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\) are there?'' and, ``how many \(k\)-element subsets of \([n]\) are there?'' have the same answer.%
\par
%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403329768384}%
Define a bijection \(f:X \to Y\) where \(X\) is the set of lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((k,n-k)\) and \(Y\) is the set of \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\). Prove that \(f\) really is a bijection.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403329988624}{}\quad{}This really comes down to how to represent the elements of the set \(X\). We represent a lattice path from \((0,0)\) to \((k, n-k)\) as a sequence of \emph{R}'s and \emph{U}'s, representing a step to the right or a step up.  Note that this means that each lattice path will be a sequence containing a total of \(n\) symbols, of which \(k\) will be \emph{R}'s.%
\par
Now we can define the bijection.  The function \(f\) takes a string of \emph{R}'s and \emph{U}'s, and replaces each \emph{R} with a 1 and each \emph{U} with a 0.%
\par
To prove this is a bijection, there are four things we need to check:%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}That \(f(x)\) is defined for each \(x \in X\) (i.e., every lattice path is sent to some \(n\)-bit string of weight \(k\)).%
\item{}That \(f(x)\) is \emph{uniquely} defined for each \(x \in X\) (i.e., no lattice path is sent to more than one bit string).%
\item{}That every \(y \in Y\) is the image of at least one \(x \in X\) (i.e., that every \(n\)-bit string of weight \(k\) is the output of the function at least once).%
\item{}That every \(y \in Y\) is the image of at most one \(x \in X\) (i.e., that no \(n\)-bit string of weight \(k\) is the output of the function more than once.)%
\end{enumerate}
The first two conditions guarantee that \(f\) will be a function.  The third says that \(f\) is onto (a surjection).  The fourth says that \(f\) is one-to-one (an injection).%
\par
Let's do this.  First, since elements in \(X\) contain \(k\) \emph{R}'s and \(n-k\) \emph{U}'s, applying the rule for \(f\) will result in a bit string containing \(k\) 1's and \(n-k\) 0's, for a total length of \(n\).  Thus each element of \(X\) will be sent to an element of \(Y\).  Further, it is not possible for an element of \(X\) to be sent to more than one element of \(Y\) since our procedure is well defined.%
\par
To show that \(f\) is surjective, consider an arbitrary \(y \in Y\).  If we replace each 1 with an \emph{R} and each 0 with a \emph{U}, then we get an element \(x \in X\) (because of the length of weight of the strings) and then \(f(x) = y\).%
\par
Finally, to show that \(f\) is injective, consider \(x_1, x_2 \in X\) and suppose \(x_1 \ne x_2\).  Then there is a first position in which they differ (a point on the lattice path where one path goes right and the other goes up).  But then this bit will be different in \(f(x_1)\) and \(f(x_2)\).%
\end{example}
\begin{exploration}{}{g:exploration:idp403342679376}%
Define a bijection \(f:X \to Y\) where \(X\) is the set of \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\) and \(Y\) is set of \(k\)-element subsets of \([n] = \{1,2,3,\ldots, n\}\).  Again, prove that \(f\) is a bijection.%
\end{exploration}
\begin{exploration}{}{g:exploration:idp403342683984}%
Can you now conclude that the number of lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((k,n-k)\) is the same as the number of \(k\)-element subsets of \([n]\)?  Can you easily give the bijection (and be sure it is really a bijection)?%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403342686896-back}{[Hint]}}\end{exploration}
What the example and problems above say is that all these counting questions correspond to each other.  But why do the answers always appear in Pascal's triangle?  To answer this, we need to start with a definition for the numbers in Pascal's triangle.%
\par
First, some notation: let's write \(\binom{n}{k}\) for the \(k\)th entry in row \(n\).  For both \(n\) and \(k\), start counting at 0.  So for example \(\binom{5}{1} = 5\), and \(\binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n} = 1\) for all \(n\) (or at least the ones we can see).  We will read \(\binom{n}{k}\) as ``\(n\) choose \(k\)'' for reasons that will become clear soon.%
\par
Now we need to decide what \(\binom{n}{k}\) should be defined as.  It is not enough to simply define it as the specific entry in Pascal's triangle, since we haven't yet defined Pascal's triangle (we will want to define Pascal's triangle as the triangle of the numbers \(\binom{n}{k}\)).  Here are some choices:%
\begin{assemblage}{Possible Definitions for \(\binom{n}{k}\).}{g:assemblage:idp403342695456}%
\index{binomial coefficients} For each integer \(n \ge 0\) and integer \(k\) with \(0 \le k \le n\) the number%
\begin{equation*}
{n\choose k},
\end{equation*}
read ``\(n\) choose \(k\)'' is:%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}the number of \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\), that is, \({n\choose k} = |\B^n_k|\).%
\item{}\({n \choose k}\) is the number of subsets of a set of size \(n\) each with cardinality \(k\).%
\item{}\({n \choose k}\) is the number of lattice paths of length \(n\) containing \(k\) steps to the right.%
\item{}\({n \choose k}\) is the coefficient of \(x^ky^{n-k}\) in the expansion of \((x+y)^n\).%
\item{}\({n \choose k}\) is the number of ways to select \(k\) objects from a total of \(n\) objects.%
\item{}\(\binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n} = 1\) and for all \(n \ge 1\) and \(1 \lt k \lt n\) we have \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}\).%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{assemblage}
You have already proved that choices 1, 2 and 3 are equivalent, and we have good reason to believe these are also equivalent to choice 4.%
\par
What about choice 5?  This is new, although not really, as it captures all of the previous four: Each of our counting problems above can be viewed in this way:%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}How many bit strings have length 5 and weight 3?  We must choose \(3\) of the 5 bits to be 1's.  There are \({5 \choose 3}\) ways to do this, so there are \({5 \choose 3}\) such bit strings.%
\item{}How many subsets of \(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\) contain exactly 3 elements?  We must choose \(3\) of the 5 elements to be in our subset.  There are \({5 \choose 3}\) ways to do this, so there are \({5 \choose 3}\) such subsets.%
\item{}How many lattice paths are there from (0,0) to (3,2)?  We must choose 3 of the 5 steps to be towards the right.  There are \({5 \choose 3}\) ways to do this, so there are \({5 \choose 3}\) such lattice paths.%
\item{}What is the coefficient of \(x^3y^2\) in the expansion of \((x+y)^5\)?  We must choose 3 of the 5 copies of the binomial to contribute an \(x\).  There are \({5 \choose 3}\) ways to do this, so the coefficient is \({5 \choose 3}\).%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
In fact, choice 5 is usually taken as the definition of \(\binom{n}{k}\), which is why we say \(n\) \emph{choose} \(k\).  Although interestingly enough, the other common name for \(\binom{n}{k}\) is a \terminology{binomial coefficient}, which refers to the coefficients of the binomial \((x+y)^n\).%
\par
What does all this have to do with Pascal's triangle though?  You might think of the entries in the triangle as the result of adding the two entries above it.  That is, Pascal's triangle contains those numbers described by choice 6 above.%
\begin{assemblage}{Recurrence relation for \({n \choose k}\).}{g:assemblage:idp403342725584}%
For any \(n \ge 1\) and \(0 \lt k \lt n\):%
\begin{equation*}
{n \choose k} = {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
The last piece of the puzzle is to connect this definition to all the others.  Of course given the work done above, it would be enough to prove that any one of the models for binomial coefficients match the recurrence for Pascal's triangle, but it is instructive to check all four.%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403342729184}%
Prove that bit strings satisfy the same recurrence as Pascal's triangle.  That is prove that \(|\B^n_k| = |\B^{n-1}_{k-1}| + |\B^{n-1}_k|\).%

\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403342730816}{}\quad{}Partition the \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\) into two disjoint sets: those that start with a 0 and those that start with a 1.

There are \(|\B^{n-1}_{k-1}|\) of these. Each \(n\)-bit string that starts with a 0 ends with an \((n-1)\)-bit string of weight \(k\).  There are \(|\B^{n-1}_k|\) of these.

\item{}Prove that lattice paths satisfy the same recurrence as Pascal's triangle.  What exactly do you need to prove here?%
\item{}Prove that binomial coefficients (the actual coefficients of the expansion of the binomial \((x+y)^n\)) satisfy the same recurrence as Pascal's triangle.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
At last we can rest easy that we can use Pascal's triangle to calculate binomial coefficients and as such find numeric values for the answers to counting questions. How many pizza's containing three distinct toppings can you make if the pizza place offers 10 toppings?  Well the answer should be \(\binom{10}{3}\), and Pascal's triangle says that is 120.%

\begin{introduction}{}%
 In this section, we will consider a few proof techniques particular to combinatorics.  Along the way we will establish some basic counting principles and further develop our understanding of binomial coefficients.%
\par
Why do we care about proofs?  It is not because we doubt the truth of so called theorems or wish to establish new results to further mathematics as an academic discipline (although there is nothing wrong with doing that as well).  Rather, it is through creating proofs that we gain a deeper understanding of the big ideas present in this subject.%

%
\begin{subsectionptx}{Two Motivating Examples}{}{Two Motivating Examples}{}{}{x:subsection:subsec-basic-proofs-examples}
To get started, let's consider two typical statements in combinatorics which we might wish to prove.%
\begin{theorem}{}{}{x:theorem:thm-pascalsym}%
For all \(n \ge 0\) and all \(0 \le k \le n\) we have \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\).  In other words, Pascal's triangle is symmetric reflected over its vertical altitude.%
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}{}{}{x:theorem:thm-pascalrowsum}%
For all \(n \ge 0\), we have \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} = 2^n\).  That is, the sum of the entries in the \(n\)th row of Pascal's triangle is \(2^n\).%
\end{theorem}
These are just two of the beautiful identities hidden in Pascal's triangle.  But why are they true?%
\par
There are at least four very distinct proofs we could give for each of these theorems.  The next activities and examples will walk you through a few.%
\par
Note: throughout this section especially, hints to problems are available.  Try the problem first, and if you get stuck, peek at the hint.%
\par
First, let's try some proofs of \hyperref[x:theorem:thm-pascalsym]{Theorem~\ref{x:theorem:thm-pascalsym}}%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403342759920}%
First, an algebraic proof.  We will see later that \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\), where \(r! = r \cdot (r-1) \cdot (r-2) \cdot\cdots\cdot 2\cdot 1\) (read ``\(r\) factorial'').  Using this algebraic formula, prove the identity \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\).%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403342763184-back}{[Hint]}}\end{activity}
Note that this proof was not by any means difficult, but it did rely on an algebraic identity we have yet to prove.  We will see in \hyperref[x:activity:act-pascalrowsum-alg]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:act-pascalrowsum-alg}} that algebraic proofs can be very messy.  What's more, algebraic proofs rarely explain \emph{why} an identity is true.  They lack meaning.%
\par
Slightly more meaning can be found in proofs by induction.  There at least you see the connection to the recursion defining the terms.  We give an example of such an argument here.%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403342769824}%
We claim the identity \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\) is true for all \(n \ge 0\), so induction would be a natural proof technique to try.  Give a proof by mathematical induction on \(n\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403342772464}{}\quad{}We will do induction on \(n\).  For \(n = 0\), the only value of \(k\) that is interesting is \(k=0\), and here \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{0}{0} = \binom{n}{n-k}\).  Thus the base case is established.%
\par
For the inductive case, fix an arbitrary \(n\) and assume that for all \(k\) with \(0 \le k \le n-1\) we have \(\binom{n-1}{k} = \binom{n-1}{(n-1)-k}\).  Consider \(\binom{n}{k}\) for an arbitrary \(0 \le k \lt n\).  By the recurssion for Pascal's triangle, we have%
\begin{equation*}
\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}.
\end{equation*}
Now apply the induction hypothesis to the right hand side.  We get%
\begin{equation*}
\binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k} = \binom{n-1}{n-1-(k-1)} + \binom{n-1}{n-1 -k} = \binom{n-1}{n-k} + \binom{n-1}{n-k-1}.
\end{equation*}
Then using the Pascal recurrence again, we get%
\begin{equation*}
\binom{n-1}{n-k} + \binom{n-1}{n-k-1} = \binom{n}{n-k}.
\end{equation*}
Thus \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\), as long as \(0 \le k \lt n\).  The case where \(k = n\) is trivial as \(\binom{n}{n} = \binom{n}{0} = 1\).%
\end{example}
The next two proofs are examples of \terminology{combinatorial proofs}.%
\begin{activity}{}{x:activity:act-pascalsym-dc}%
Think about what \(\binom{n}{k}\) counts.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}Suppose you own \(n\) bow ties, and want to choose \(k\) of them to take on a trip.  How many different collections of bow ties can you take?%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343030688-back}{[Hint]}}\item{}Why is the answer to the above question also \(\binom{n}{n-k}\)?%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343035344-back}{[Hint]}}\item{}Why are the two parts above enough to establish the identity \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\)?%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
Finally, here is a subtly different proof.%
\begin{activity}{}{x:activity:act-pascalsym-bij}%
Consider the set \([n] = \{1,2,\ldots,n\}\) and its power set \(\pow([n])\) of all subsets of \([n]\).  Define the function \(f:\pow([n]) \to \pow([n])\) by \(f(A) = [n]\setminus A\) for any \(A \in \pow([n])\) (that is, \(f(A)\) is the complement of \(A\) in \([n]\)).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}Prove that \(f\) is a bijection.  In fact, \(f\) is an \terminology{involution} in that it is its own inverse.%
\item{}For any set \(A \in \pow([n])\), if \(\card{A} = k\), what is the \(\card{f(A)}\)?%
\item{}Is \(f\) still a bijection if we restrict it to just the subsets of \([n]\) that have size \(k\)?  Perhaps we should also restrict our codomain (to what?).  Explain.%
\item{}Why is the above enough to establish the identity \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\)?%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343057696-back}{[Hint]}}\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
How are \hyperref[x:activity:act-pascalsym-dc]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:act-pascalsym-dc}} and \hyperref[x:activity:act-pascalsym-bij]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:act-pascalsym-bij}} different?  The first consists of answering a single counting question in two different ways, and those ways are the two sides of the identity.  Such proofs are sometimes called \emph{double counting proofs}, or sometimes just \emph{combinatorial proofs}.  On the other hand, \hyperref[x:activity:act-pascalsym-bij]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:act-pascalsym-bij}} proceeds by showing two different sets have the same size, using a bijection, and shows that these two sets are counted by each side of the identity.  These proofs are called \emph{bijective proofs} (and are also sometimes grouped together with double counting proofs as combinatorial proofs).%
\par
Here is yet another combinatorial proof of the identity \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\).  We give both double counting and bijective variants.%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403343065008}%
Prove that \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\) using bit strings.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403343066544}{}\quad{}\(\binom{n}{k}\) counts the number of \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\).  This is because of the \(n\) bits, we must choose \(k\) to be 1's, which can be done in \(\binom{n}{k}\) ways.  The number of \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\) is also \(\binom{n}{n-k}\), since of the \(n\) bits, we must choose \(n-k\) to be 0's (making the remaining \(k\) 1's), which can be done in \(\binom{n}{n-k}\) ways.  Thus \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\).%
\par
The above is a complete proof, but really \(\binom{n}{k}\) can be thought of as \emph{defined} as the size of the set \(\B^n_k\).  But then \(\binom{n}{n-k}\) is the size of the set \(\B^n_{n-k}\).  So what we are really saying here is that \(|\B^n_k| = |\B^n_{n-k}|\), which is true because the function that switches 0's to 1's and 1's to 0's in a bit string is a bijection between these two sets.%
\end{example}
Both styles of combinatorial proof have the advantage that they do an excellent job of illustrating what is really going on in an identity.  They reinforce our understanding of how to solve counting problems and our understanding of basic combinatorial principles.%
\par
This is not to say that other proof techniques, especially mathematical induction, are not also helpful.  Inductive proofs demonstrate the importance of the recursive nature of combinatorics.  Even if we didn't know what Pascal's triangle told us about the real world, we would see that the identity was true entirely based on the recursive definition of its entries.%
\par
Now here are four proofs of \hyperref[x:theorem:thm-pascalrowsum]{Theorem~\ref{x:theorem:thm-pascalrowsum}}.%
\begin{activity}{}{x:activity:act-pascalrowsum-alg}%
Using the formula \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k!)}\), you should be able to find a common denominator in the sum \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}\) and show that this simplifies to \(2^n\).%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343082128-back}{[Hint]}}\end{activity}
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403343083584}%
We wish to establish the identity \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} = 2^n\) for all natural numbers \(n\), so it would be natural to give a proof by induction.  Do this.%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343085632-back}{[Hint]}}\end{activity}
There are lots of ways to give a combinatorial proof.  Here is one.%
\begin{activity}{}{x:activity:activity-pascalrow-dc}%
Consider the question: how many subsets of \([n]\) are there?%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}How many subsets have cardinality 0?  How many have cardinality 1?  And so on.  How many would all of these give us all together?%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343098672-back}{[Hint]}}\item{}Explain why the answer is also \(2^n\).%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343104416-back}{[Hint]}}\end{enumerate}
Conclude: Since each side of the identity is the answer to the same counting question, we have established the identity.%
\end{activity}
We will not give a bijective proof, although you might include this as part of the above if you didn't see why \(2^n\) was the number of subsets of \([n]\).  Instead, you might see directly that \(2^n\) is the number of \(n\)-bit strings (by writing the numbers 0 through \(2^n - 1\) in binary) and then define a bijection from \(n\)-bit strings to subsets of \([n]\).%
\par
Finally, here is a clever proof of the identity.%
\begin{activity}{}{x:activity:act-pascalrowsum-binom}%
What does the binomial theorem say again?  That is, expand \((x+y)^n\).  What happens when you substitute \(x = y = 1\)?%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343116096-back}{[Hint]}}\end{activity}
This use of the binomial theorem is an example of one of the many uses for \emph{generating functions} which we will return to later.  For now, you might enjoy plugging in other values to the binomial theorem to uncover new binomial identities.%

\begin{subsectionptx}{Interlude: The Sum and Product Principles}{}{Interlude: The Sum and Product Principles}{}{}{x:subsection:subsec-sumprod}
Any proof you write in mathematics must assume some foundational principles.  In Euclidean geometry, you have axioms, common notions, and often other propositions, used as justification in your proof.  Let's pause to consider two foundational principles in combinatorics that, while intuitively obvious, are worth pointing out as foundational.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403343122816}%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}A restaurant offers 8 appetizers and 14 entrées. How many choices do you have if:%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}you will eat one dish, either an appetizer or an entrée?%
\item{}you are extra hungry and want to eat both an appetizer and an entrée?%
\end{enumerate}
%
\item{}Think about the methods you used to solve question (a). Write down the rules for these methods.%
\item{}Do your rules work? A standard deck of playing cards has 26 red cards and 12 face cards.%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}How many ways can you select a card which is either red or a face card?%
\item{}How many ways can you select a card which is both red and a face card?%
\item{}How many ways can you select two cards so that the first one is red and the second one is a face card?%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
When solving a counting question, it is often advantageous to break the problem into parts.  If you think of the counting question as asking how many ways there are to complete a task, then you might break that task up in various ways, count the number of ways to complete each sub-task, and them combine those somehow to get the number of ways to complete the overall task.  How do you combine them?%
\begin{assemblage}{Sum Principle.}{g:assemblage:idp403343130848}%
The \terminology{sum principle}\index{sum principle} states that if task \(A\) can be completed in \(m\) ways, and task \(B\) can be completed in \(n\) \emph{disjoint} ways, then completing ``\(A\) or \(B\)'' is a task that can be completed in \(m + n\) ways.%
\end{assemblage}
\begin{assemblage}{Product Principle.}{g:assemblage:idp403343136400}%
The \terminology{product principle}\index{product principle} states that if task \(A\) can be completed in \(m\) ways, and each possibility for \(A\) allows for exactly \(n\) ways for task \(B\) to be completed, then the task ``\(A\) and \(B\)'' (or ``\(A\) followed by \(B\)'') can be completed in \(m \cdot n\) ways.%
\end{assemblage}
Note, both the sum and product principles are true for more than two subtasks.  You could prove this easily by induction using the principles for two sets as your base case.  But how do we know the principles for two sets are true?%
\par
To make the sum and product principles more mathematically rigorous, consider operations on sets.%
\begin{proposition}{}{}{x:proposition:prop-unioncard}%
If \(A\) and \(B\) are finite, disjoint sets (so \(A \cap B = \emptyset\)) then \(\card{A \cup B} = \card{A} + \card{B}\).%
\end{proposition}
This suggests that the union of (disjoint) sets somehow corresponds to the \emph{disjunction} (or) of completing tasks.  You might guess that the set operation that corresponds to \emph{conjunction} (and) of tasks is set intersection.  But this cannot be correct: the intersection of two sets is no larger than the smallest of the two sets, while combining tasks with conjunction apparently corresponds to multiplication.%
\par
A better way to think of the conjunction is as \emph{concatenation}.  You are performing one task, \emph{followed} by the other.  Recall that \(A \times B = \{(a,b) \st a \in A, b \in B\}\) is the \terminology{Cartesian product} of \(A\) and \(B\); the set of all ordered pairs where the first element comes from \(A\) and the second from \(B\).  This is exactly what we need.%
\begin{proposition}{}{}{x:proposition:prop-prodcard}%
If \(A\) and \(B\) are finite sets, then \(\card{A \times B} = \card{A} \cdot \card{B}\)%
\end{proposition}
We could prove these two propositions without too much trouble.  Then we must explain what they have to do with the sum and product principles.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403343156336}%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]

\item{}Make explicit the connection between the Sum Principle and \hyperref[x:proposition:prop-unioncard]{Proposition~\ref{x:proposition:prop-unioncard}}.  That is, justify the Sum Principle in terms of cardinality of sets.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403343163664}%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}Explain why \hyperref[x:proposition:prop-prodcard]{Proposition~\ref{x:proposition:prop-prodcard}} is true.  Your explanation should make use of \hyperref[x:proposition:prop-unioncard]{Proposition~\ref{x:proposition:prop-unioncard}}.%
\item{}Using the same incomplete deck of cards (containing the Jack, King and Queen of diamonds, King of hearts, and 2 through 6 of spades), the magician asks you to put any face card face down under any face down black card.  How many choices do you have for this two card stack?%
\item{}How exactly does the counting question above relate to \hyperref[x:proposition:prop-prodcard]{Proposition~\ref{x:proposition:prop-prodcard}}?  How exactly does it relate to the Product Principle?  Illustrate both by listing specific outcomes.%

\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
The previous activity might obscure an important subtlety.  Perhaps you said that the set \(A\) corresponds to the face cards (or to the set of outcomes of the task of selecting a face card) and the set \(B\) corresponded to the black cards.  The set of outcomes of picking a two card stack is exactly then \(A \times B\), so there are \(4\cdot 5 = 20\) outcomes.  This is completely correct.  But does it generalize?%
\begin{activity}{}{x:activity:act-cardstacks}%
Suppose the magician hands you 4 cards (the Ace, King, Queen, and Jack of clubs) and asks you to select any two cards (placing them face down in a stack).  How many choices do you have?  Assume the order the cards are placed down matters.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}If you divide the task into two sub-tasks, what are they?  How many ways can you complete the first task?  How many ways can you complete the second?  What is the final answer?%
\item{}If you think of this problem as counting a Cartesian product, what is set \(A\)?  What is set \(B\)?  What is wrong?%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
The Product Principle is not exactly analogous to finding the cardinality of a Cartesian product after all, since tasks \(A\) and \(B\) do not need to be disjoint.  How do we make sense of the Product Principle then?%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403343179984}%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}Write out all stacks of cards that are possible outcomes in \hyperref[x:activity:act-cardstacks]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:act-cardstacks}}.  Arrange these into a rectangle of appropriate dimensions.%
\item{}How might you group the outcomes in a meaningful way?  How many groups and how many outcomes in each group?%
\item{}Find some sets \(A\) and \(B\) and a bijection between the outcomes (stacks of 2 cards) and the set \(A \times B\).  Describe how this would work in general.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
To illustrate just how fundamental these two principles are, here are a few counting problems that can be solved with them.  For each of these, say exactly where and how the sum and product principles are used.%
\begin{exploration}{}{x:exploration:act-latticepaths2}%
We have seen that the number of lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((x,y)\) is given by \(\binom{x+y}{x}\).  Now with the sum and product principles, we can answer lots of questions about lattice paths.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}How many lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((10,10)\) pass through the point \((4,7)\)?%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343190896-back}{[Hint]}}\item{}How many lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((10,10)\) do NOT pass through the point \((4,7)\)?  In what way does this problem use the sum principle?%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343195136-back}{[Hint]}}\item{}How many lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((10,10)\) pass through \((4,7)\) or \((7,4)\)?%
\item{}Explain why can you NOT use the sum principle to answer this question: How many lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((10,10)\) pass through \((4,7)\) or \((7,8)\)?  What is the answer?%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343203040-back}{[Hint]}}\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
The last part of the previous problem illustrates what can go wrong if the sets \(A\) and \(B\) are not disjoint.  In general, we have,%
\begin{equation*}
\card{A \cup B} = \card{A} + \card{B} - \card{A \cap B}.
\end{equation*}
This is an example of the \emph{Principle of Inclusion\slash{}Exclusion}, which we will investigate further later.%
\par
This next set of questions you can answer entirely using the product principle.  While all the activities ask questions with a general \(n\) and \(k\), it would be a good idea to first try to answer the corresponding question with specific numbers and then generalize.%
\begin{exploration}{}{x:exploration:SubsetsFirstTime}%
How many subsets does a set \(S\) with \(n\) elements have?%

\begin{exploration}{}{x:exploration:tennispairings1}%
A tennis club has \(2n\) members. We want to pair up the members by twos for singles matches.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]

\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343228560-back}{[Hint]}}\end{exploration}
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403343233696}%
Here are two counting problems, easier than the last two activities, that will lead us to an important general principle.%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}In how many ways can we pass out \(k\) distinct pieces of fruit to \(n\) children (with no restriction on how many pieces of fruit a child may get)?%
\item{}Assuming \(k\le n\), in how many ways can we pass out \(k\) distinct pieces of fruit to \(n\) children if each child may get at most one? What is the number if \(k \gt n\)? Assume for both questions that we pass out all the fruit.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403343239344}{}\quad{}%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}We must decide on a child for each piece of fruit.  There are \(n\) choices for the first piece of fruit, \(n\) choices for the second, and so on.  The product principle says that there will be \(n^k\) ways to distribute the fruit.%
\par
Slightly more mathematically speaking, we are counting the number of functions from a set of cardinality \(k\) (the fuits) to a set of cardinality \(n\) (the children).  Note that it does not make sense to think of the ways we can send the children to the fruit, since we do not require that every child gets a fruit, and we insist that all fruit is distributed.%
\item{}The only thing that changes for the second part is that no child can get more than one piece of fruit.  So while we have \(n\) choices for the first piece of fruit, we only have \(n-1\) for the second, and \(n-2\) for the third.  Continuing until all the fruit is gone gives us a total of,%
\begin{equation*}
n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \cdots \cdot (n-k+1) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} 
\end{equation*}
ways to distribute the fruit.%
\par
If \(k \gt n\), then the left-hand-side still works: one of the terms will be 0, and indeed, if there is more fruit than children, there is no way to pass out all the fruit while ensuring that each kid gets at most one fruit.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{example}
The last question is an example of a \terminology{permutation}.  We are asking how to arrange \(k\) of the \(n\) kids (arranged by which fruit they get).  There are \(n!\) ways to arrange \(n\) elements, so there are \(n!\) permutations of \(n\) elements.  Often we only want to arrange some of these, so we would consider a \(k\)-permutation.   We will use this often enough that it deserves its own notation.%
\begin{assemblage}{\(k\)-permutations of \(n\) elements.}{x:assemblage:assemblage-permutation}%
\(P(n,k)\) is the number of \(k\)-permutations of \(n\) elements, the number of ways to \emph{arrange} \(k\) objects chosen from \(n\) distinct objects.%
\begin{equation*}
P(n,k) = n\cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \cdots \cdot (n-k+1) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
Some other examples of questions where the answer is a permutation:%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}How many 5-letter ``words'' (i.e., strings of symbols) contain no repeated letters?  There are 26 choices for the first letter, 25 for the second, 24 for the third, 23 for the fourth and 22 for the fifth, so there are \(26\cdot 25 \cdot 24 \cdot 23 \cdot 22 = P(26,5)\) such words.%
\item{}How many different shuffled decks of cards are possible?  There are 52 choices for the bottom card, 51 for the next, and so on.  So the answer is \(P(52,52) = 52!\)%
\item{}How many \emph{injective} functions from \([k]\) to \([n]\) are there?  There are \(n\) choices for where 1 is sent, \(n-1\) choices for where \(2\) is sent (since the function is injective, 2 cannot be sent to the same element as 1), and so on.  So the answer is \(P(n,k)\).%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
While we are looking at permutations, let's also consider their counterpart, \emph{combinations}. The key distinction is that while a permutation counts different arrangements as different outcomes, a combination does not.  Combinations are \emph{selecting}, while permutations are \emph{arranging} (and also selecting).%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403343266816}%

Hopefully you realized that the number of \(k\)-combinations of \(n\) elements is just \(\binom{n}{k}\).  This makes sense: you just need to choose which elements to take, you don't need to arrange them.%
\par
Notice though that combinations and permutations \emph{are} related in some way.  What is that way?  Well, once you have chosen \(k\) elements from an \(n\)-element set, you could then \emph{arrange} those \(k\) elements to get a permutation.%

\begin{subsectionptx}{More Proofs}{}{More Proofs}{}{}{x:subsection:subsec-moreproofs}
We will use the proof techniques of double counting and bijections throughout the rest of the book, but for now, let's practice a bit.  The activities below ask you to give a combinatorial proof, and often also an alternative proof that has some nice features.%
\begin{example}{}{x:example:act-redgreenballs}%
Prove the identity \(\binom{2n}{2} = 2 \binom{n}{2} + n^{2}\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint}.\hypertarget{g:hint:idp403343300144}{}\quad{}Think of selecting two balls from a set of \(n\) distinct red balls and \(n\) distinct green balls.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403343301856}{}\quad{}Split the \(2n\) objects into two groups \(A\) and \(B\) each of size \(n\).%
\par
First, you can choose 2 objects from a set of \(2n\) objects in \(\binom{2n}{2}\) ways. Alternatively, you could select two from group \(A\) in \(\binom{n}{2}\) ways or two from group \(B\) in \(\binom{n}{2}\) ways or take one from each in \(n \cdot n = n^{2}\) ways. Now add \(\binom{n}{2} + \binom{n}{2}+ n \cdot n\) and the result follows.%
\end{example}
The reader should attempt an algebraic proof of the above result using the factorial formula for \(\binom{n}{k}\).%
\begin{exploration}{}{x:exploration:act-bowtiefez}%
Prove the identity \(\binom{m + n}{2} - \binom{m}{2} - \binom{n}{2} = mn\).%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343311392-back}{[Hint]}}\end{exploration}
You could also attempt an algebraic proof or perhaps a geometric proof making use of figures consisting of triangular numbers (we will return to this identity at the end of the section to illustrate this). Also, as a challenge, the reader could formulate a similar result involving \(\binom{a + b + c}{3}\) and a corresponding proof.%
\begin{exploration}{}{g:exploration:idp403343319200}%
We have already proved this identity: \(\binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1} + \binom{n}{2} + \ldots + \binom{n}{n} = 2^{n}\).  Now try giving a combinatorial proof that uses lattice paths.%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343320864-back}{[Hint]}}\end{exploration}
Becoming an expert in combinatorial proofs will help you solve actual counting problems.  For example, you might wonder how many positive integers have their digits in strictly increasing order.%
\begin{exploration}{}{g:exploration:idp403343323888}%
Prove that the number of positive integers that have their digits in strictly increasing order is \(2^{9} - 1\). Include single digit numbers.%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343325520-back}{[Hint]}}\end{exploration}
Now back to some combinatorial proofs.%
\begin{example}{}{x:example:act_anysizecommittee}%
Prove \(\binom{n}{1} + 2 \binom{n}{2} + 3 \binom{n}{3} + \ldots + n \binom{n}{n} = n2^{n - 1}\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403343335184}{}\quad{}Given a set of \(n\) people we can select a committee of size \(k\) along with a chair from that committee in \(k \binom{n}{k}\) ways. We can select a committee (of size 1, or size 2, or \textellipsis{}) and its chair in \(\binom{n}{1} + 2 \binom{n}{2} + 3 \binom{n}{3} + \ldots + n \binom{n}{n}\) ways. Alternatively, we can explain the term \(n2^{n - 1}\) as follows: choose one of the \(n\) people to chair any of the \(2^{n - 1}\) subsets of the remaining \(n - 1\) people.%
\end{example}
Some other ways to approach the previous identity might be one or more of the following: \(n2^{n - 1}\) looks like a derivative, so try differentiating \(\left( 1 + x \right)^{n}\); a reverse and add approach also works; or, first prove \(k \binom{n}{k} = n \binom{n - 1}{k - 1}\) and then use it.%
\begin{exploration}{}{g:exploration:idp403343342048}%
Prove the Pascal recurrence: \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n - 1}{k-1} + \binom{n - 1}{k}\).  Do this in two ways, first with a double counting style proof, and then a bijective proof.%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343343712-back}{[Hint]}}\end{exploration}
The above activity illustrates another important reason to use combinatorial proofs: to establish recurrence relations.  The next identity is also a recurrence, this time about \emph{derangements}.%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403343353632}%
A \terminology{derangement} of a set of elements is a permutation of those elements so that no element appears in its original position.  For example, a derangement of \([4]\) might be \(3,1,4,2\), but the permutation \(3,2,4,1\) is not a derangement because \(2\) is still in the second position.%
\par
Let \(d_{n}\) denote the number of derangements of \([n]\).  We will take \(d_{0} = 1\) and \(d_{1} = 0\).  Prove that \(d_{n} = (n - 1)(d_{n - 1}+ d_{n - 2})\) for \(n \geq 2\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403343360656}{}\quad{}In forming a derangement of \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, n\) the integer \(n\) can be placed in any of the \(n - 1\) spots \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, n - 1\), say spot \(i\). If \(i\) goes into spot \(n\) there are \(d_{n - 2}\) ways to finish it. If \(i\) does not go into spot \(n\) there are \(d_{n - 1}\) ways to complete the derangement.%
\end{example}
Later we will use the Principle of Inclusion\slash{}Exclusion to derive a formula for \(d_{n}\) from which the new recursion \(d_{n} = nd_{n - 1} + \left( - 1 \right)^{n}\), and the above recursion, can be derived.%
\par
Let's get back to binomial identities.%
\begin{example}{}{x:example:eg_binom-squares-sum}%
Prove, \(\binom{n}{0}^{2} + \binom{n}{1}^{2} + \binom{n}{2}^{2} + \ldots + \binom{n}{n}^{2} = \binom{2n}{n}\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint}.\hypertarget{g:hint:idp403343370160}{}\quad{}First note that \(\binom{n}{k}^2 = \binom{n}{k}\binom{n}{n-k}\), by the symmetry of Pascal's triangle.  Then, there is a nice proof using lattice paths here, or you select \(n\) things from a collection that has \(n\) things of one type and \(n\) of another.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403343372832}{}\quad{}Given a group of \(2n\) people consisting of \(n\) men and \(n\) women, in how many ways can one choose a group of \(n\) people? The answer to that question is just \(\binom{2n}{n}\), the right side of the identity in question. One could also form the group of \(n\) people in the following way: choose 0 men and \(n\) women in \(\binom{n}{0} \binom{n}{n} = \binom{n}{0}^{2}\) ways, or, choose 1 man and \(n - 1\) women in \(\binom{n}{1} \binom{n}{n - 1} = \binom{n}{1}^{2}\) ways, or choose 2 men and \(n - 2\) women in \(\binom{n}{2} \binom{n}{n - 2} = \binom{n}{2}^{2}\) ways and so on. Now add these disjoint cases.%
\par
An alternate algebraic proof is less interesting: Extract the coefficient of \(x^{n}\) from both sides of \(\left\lbrack \left( x + 1 \right)^{n} \right\rbrack^{2} = \left(x + 1 \right)^{2n}\)%
\end{example}
Here is a interesting use of the previous identity, inside an unexpected proof.%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403343381264}%
Find a nice expression for the sum%
\begin{equation*}
\binom{n}{1}^2 + 2 \binom{n}{2}^2 + 3 \binom{n}{3}^2 + \cdots + n\binom{n}{n}^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403343382896}{}\quad{}We use the ``reverse and add technique'', which we will see in \hyperref[x:subsection:subsec-recursionclosed]{Subsection~\ref{x:subsection:subsec-recursionclosed}} is usually reserved for summing arithmetic sums.  Surprisingly, it works here.%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0}{0}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{1}%
{\centering%
\begin{tabular}{rlll}
\(S  =\)&&\(\binom{n}{1}^2+2\binom{n}{2}^2+3\binom{n}{3}^2 + \)&\(\cdots +(n-1)\binom{n}{n-1}^2+n\binom{n}{n}^2\)\tabularnewline[0pt]
\(+ \quad S  =\)&\(n\binom{n}{n}^2 + \)&\((n-1)\binom{n}{n-1}^2+ \cdots +\)&\(2\binom{n}{2}^2+\binom{n}{1}^2\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(2S  =\)&\(n\binom{n}{0}^2 + \)&\(n\binom{n}{1}^2 + n\binom{n}{2}^2+ n\binom{n}{3}^2 + \)&\(\cdots + n\binom{n}{n-1}^2+n\binom{n}{n}^2\)
\end{tabular}
\par}
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
This uses the identity \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\).  Now factor out an \(n\) to get%
\begin{equation*}
2S = n\left[\binom{n}{0}^{2} + \binom{n}{1}^{2} + \binom{n}{2}^{2} + \ldots + \binom{n}{n}^{2}\right]\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Apply the identity in \hyperref[x:example:eg_binom-squares-sum]{Example~\ref{x:example:eg_binom-squares-sum}} and divide by 2 to get%
\begin{equation*}
S = \frac{n}{2}\binom{2n}{n}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{example}
The next identity is an example of the famed \terminology{Hockey Stick Theorem} (find this identity in Pascal's triangle!).%
\begin{exploration}{}{g:exploration:idp403343402496}%
Prove \(\binom{2}{2} + \binom{3}{2} + \binom{4}{2} + \ldots + \binom{n}{2} = \binom{n + 1}{3}\).%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343404064-back}{[Hint]}}\end{exploration}
For a non-combinatorial proof of the Hockey Stick Theorem, a proof by mathematical induction is an easy option. An algebraic approach is not!%
\par
If you spend enough time working on these proofs, you might find yourself discovering new identities that use the same basic setup.  You can take the proof you gave for the Hockey Stick Theorem and with a small tweak, get the following.%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403343412256}%
Prove \(1\cdot n + 2 \cdot (n-1) + 3 \cdot (n-2) + \cdots + n \cdot 1 = \binom{n+2}{3}\)%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403343414432}{}\quad{}You should try to use bit strings again, but this time think about where the \emph{second} 1 (from the left) in the bit string could go.  Or for variety, why not try asking about subsets of \([n+2]\)?%
\par
Let \(S = \{1,2,\ldots,n + 2\}\). The number of subsets of \(S\) of size 3 is \(\binom{n + 2}{3}\). Each one looks like \(\{a, b, c\}\) with \(a \lt b \lt c\). Let's count these by looking at the size of the middle element \(b\). If \(b=2\), there is one choice for \(a\), namely \(a=1\) and \(n\) choices for \(c\) for a total of \(1 \cdot n\). If \(b=3\) there are 2 choices for \(a\), and \(n - 1\) choices for \(c\) for a total of \(2(n - 1)\). If \(b=4\) the total is \(3(n - 2)\), and so on. The total derived by looking at cases is \(1 \cdot n + 2\left( n - 1 \right) + 3\left( n - 2 \right) + \ldots + n \cdot 1\) and this must equal \(\binom{n + 2}{3}\) since the cases are disjoint.%
\end{example}
\begin{exploration}{}{g:exploration:idp403343426128}%
The proof using subsets we gave for the previous identity asked about 3-element subsets of \([n+2]\).  What if we looked at 5-element subsets of \([n+3]\) and considered which the middle (third) number was?  Write a binomial identity, with a proof, that uses this idea.%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343428320-back}{[Hint]}}\end{exploration}

\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343432464-back}{[Hint]}}\end{exploration}
The previous identity can also be established using an inductive proof, or through a clever collapsing sum as follows.%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403343446528}%
To compute the sum \(1\cdot 1! + 2 \cdot 2! + \cdots + n \cdot n!\), note that \((n+1)! - n! = n\cdot n!\) (just factor out an \(n!\)).  This then makes the sum%
\begin{equation*}
(2! - 1!) + (3! - 2!) + \cdots + ((n+1)! - n!) = (n+1)! - 1 \text{.}

\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343464320-back}{[Hint]}}\end{exploration}
To close this section, let's return to a binomial identity we considered before, and consider a few additional proofs.%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403343472800}%
We give three and a half proofs of the identity \(\binom{m + n}{2} - \binom{m}{2} - \binom{n}{2} = mn\).%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}How many lines that are not vertical or horizontal can you form by connecting the points that are on the positive \(x\) and \(y\) axes?%

\end{tikzpicture}
}%
\end{sbspanel}%
\begin{sbspanel}{0.7}[center]%
Since we really want only lines that are formed by connecting the \(m\) points with the \(n\) points, we could say we have \(mn\) lines. Or we could consider all \(m + n\) points and pick 2 in \(\binom{m+n}{2}\) ways and then delete those choices where you took 2 from \(m\) or 2 from \(n\), since these formed vertical and horizontal lines, respectively.  Thus \(\binom{m + n}{2} - \binom{m}{2} - \binom{n}{2} = mn\).%

\item{}There are \(mn\) one by one squares in the subdivided \(m\) by \(n\) rectangle.%
\begin{sidebyside}{2}{0}{0}{0.1}%
\begin{sbspanel}{0.7}%
Each choice of arrows (one horizontal, one vertical) specifies one of these squares.  Pick two arrows but don't take two from the top or two from the side.  Then \(\binom{m + n}{2} - \binom{m}{2} - \binom{n}{2} = mn\).%

As suggested a few place above, there are often other interesting proofs of combinatorial results that don't use this technique.  We close this section with a few more examples of particularly elegant, non-combinatorial proofs.%
\par
We start with a well known theorem about the relationship between square and triangular numbers.%

\(n^2 = \binom{n}{2} + \binom{n+1}{2}\).%
\end{theorem}
\begin{proofptx}{}{g:proof:idp403343504304}
The key insight here is that \(\binom{n+1}{2} = T_{n}\), the \(n\)th triangular number.  With this, there is an easy ``picture proof.''  Here is the picture for \(n = 4\):%

\begin{introduction}{}%
So far we have been able to solve our counting problems simply by use of the sum and product principles, together with the fact that the number of \(k\)-element subsets of an \(n\)-element set is \(\binom{n}{k}\) (the values of which can be found in Pascal's triangle). This means that we have always \emph{built up} the set of outcomes by combining smaller sets of outcomes combined in various ways.%
\par
It is often useful to go the other way.  We could purposely over count the number of outcomes, but in a way that we can recover the correct set.%

%
\begin{subsectionptx}{The Quotient Principle}{}{The Quotient Principle}{}{}{x:subsection:subsec-quotient}
In \hyperref[x:exploration:act-binomformula]{Exercise~\ref{x:exploration:act-binomformula}}, you proved the algebraic formula \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}\).  However, this was done rather indirectly.  First you proved the identity \(P(n,k) = \binom{n}{k}k!\), then wrote \(P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\), and finally solved for \(\binom{n}{k}\).%
\par
This approach has the advantage of illustrating the connection between combinations and permutations, but the combinatorial argument that both sides of the identity are equal asked you to count the number of \emph{permutations} in two ways.  It is instructive to think of this equation in terms of \emph{combinations} instead.  Let's start with a concrete example.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403343534800}%
Let's count the number of subsets of \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\) of size 3.  Of course we already know the answer should be \(\binom{5}{3}\), which we can see in Pascal's triangle is equal to 10.  What might you try if you didn't already know this?%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}You might first guess that the answer is \(5\cdot 4 \cdot 3\) since there are 5 choices for which element you put in your subset first, then  4 choices for the next element, and 3 choices for the last element.  Write down all 60 of the outcomes you get by counting the ``subsets'' this way.\footnotemark{}%
\item{}One of the subsets we are actually interested in is \(\{a,c,d\}\).  How many of the outcomes you listed above correspond to this set?  How many outcomes correspond to the set \(\{c,d,e\}\)?%
\item{}Explain why every subset corresponds to the same number of permutations.  Then use this to count the total number of subsets correctly.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
\footnotetext[1]{This might seem like a lot of busy work, but your efforts will be rewarded.\label{g:fn:idp403343538848}}%
Let's look carefully at what we did above.  We had a set of permutations (all 60 of the 3-permutations of the set \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\)).  Then we noticed that some of these permutations corresponded the the same subset.  Saying that these permutations were related like this feels like defining a equivalence relation.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403343598992}%
Refer back to your list of 60 3-permutations of \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}Define an \terminology{equivalence relation} on the permutations you listed so that permutations that ``correspond'' to the same subset are equivalent.  That is, give a rule that specifies when two permutations are ``equivalent''.%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343603072-back}{[Hint]}}\item{}In any set \(S\), if you have an equivalence relation \(\sim\), you can \terminology{partition} \(S\) into \terminology{equivalence classes}: sets of elements that are equivalent under \(\sim\) (i.e., sets of the form \(\{x \in S \st x \sim a\} \) for a particular element \(a\)).%
\par
Write out the equivalence classes generated by the equivalence relation you gave above.  Explain why these all have the same size.  How many equivalence classes do you have (and how does this relate to the fact that they all have the same size)?%
\item{}Find a bijection between the set of equivalence classes and the set of subsets of \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\).  Why is this important?%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343611152-back}{[Hint]}}\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
This suggests a general approach to solving a counting problem.  Say we want to count the number of elements in a set \(S\).  Suppose we can count the size of some set \(T\), perhaps containing many more elements than we are actually interested in counting.  Then define an equivalence relation \(\sim\) on \(T\) so that there is a bijection between \(S\) and the set of equivalence classes \(T/\sim\).  Then if we know the size of \(T/\sim\), we have the size of \(S\).%
\par
Look at the notation \(T/\sim\) that we used to denote the set of equivalence classes of \(T\) under \(\sim\).  This set is sometimes called the \terminology{quotient set} or \terminology{quotient space} of \(T\) by \(\sim\).  This is a good name, as you are dividing up a set into parts.  It is also a good name because sometimes we can conclude%
\begin{equation*}
|T/\sim| = |T|/|A|
\end{equation*}
where \(A\) is one of the equivalence classes under \(\sim\).  When can you do this?%
\par
Note this is exactly what we did when we counted subsets: we divided the number of permutations by the number of permutations equivalent to each other.  That worked precisely because \emph{all the equivalence classes had the same size}!%
\par
This justifies the \terminology{quotient principle} we now state.%
\begin{assemblage}{The Quotient Principle.}{x:assemblage:assemblage-quotientprinciple}%
If we partition a set of size \(p\) into \(q\) blocks, each of size \(r\), then \(q = p/r\).%
\end{assemblage}
Like the product principle, the quotient principle is really just a statement about how division works.  Here are a few examples of how you can use it in counting.  In each of the following activities, make sure you can say exactly how the quotient principle could be used.%
\begin{exploration}{}{x:exploration:roundtable}%
In how many ways may \(n\) people sit around a round table? (Assume that when people are sitting around a round table, all that really matters is who is to each person's right. For example, if we can get one arrangement of people around the table from another by having everyone get up and move to the right one place and sit back down, we get an equivalent arrangement of people. Notice that you can get a list from a seating arrangement by marking a place at the table, and then listing the people at the table, starting at that place and moving around to the right.) There are at least two different ways of doing this problem. Try to find them both, especially the one that uses the quotient principle.%

(Perhaps we make the necklace by stringing the beads on a string, and then carefully gluing the two ends of the string together so that the joint can't be seen. Assume someone can pick up the necklace, move it around in space and put it back down, giving an apparently different way of stringing the beads that is equivalent to the first.)%

We have used the quotient principle to explain the formula \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}\) by thinking of this as \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{P(n,k)}{k!}\).  What if we don't involve \(P(n,k)\) at all?%
\par
Describe a set of outcomes that has size \(n!\) that can be partitioned into blocks of size \((n-k)!k!\) so that each block corresponds to something \(\binom{n}{k}\) counts.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403343687408}{}\quad{}Suppose you have \(k\) red balls and \(n-k\) blue balls.  Each ball has a different number printed on it.  Thus there are \(n!\) different ways to arrange the \(n\) balls in a line.  But what if we only care about the color pattern the balls make (perhaps the numbers have been printed in invisible ink and have now vanished).  We can arrange these permutations of all \(n\) balls into blocks, where two permutations are in the same block if and only if they have the same sequence of colors (RRBRB\textellipsis{}).  There are \((n-k)!k!\) permutations in each block, since the red balls can be arranged in \(k!\) ways and the blue balls can be arranged in \((n-k)!\) ways.%
\par
All this says that the number of two-color patterns of length \(n\) including \(k\) red balls is \(\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}\).  But of course the answer is also \(\binom{n}{k}\) because of the \(n\) positions, we must choose \(k\) positions to put the identical red balls.%

\typeout{************************************************}
%
\begin{subsectionptx}{When does Order Matter?}{}{When does Order Matter?}{}{}{x:subsection:subsec-ordermatters}
One way to distinguish combinations from permutations is by asking whether ``order matters''.  Both \(\binom{n}{k}\) and \(P(n,k)\) count the number of ways to select \(k\) objects from \(n\) objects without repeats, but you use the combination \(\binom{n}{k}\) when ``order doesn't matter'' and the permutation \(P(n,k)\) when ``order matters''.  Despite the presence of the scare quotes, this is not a false statement, but we must understand what we mean when we say ``order matters''.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403343710560}%
Each counting question below asks for two answers.  Decide which answer is a combination and which is a permutation, and why that makes sense.%

The number of \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\) is \(\binom{n}{k}\), so a combination.  But in determining one bit string from another, all that matters is the order in which the \(k\) 1's and \(n-k\) 0's appear.  So does order matter?  In what sense does it not?%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343724880-back}{[Hint]}}\end{exploration}
\begin{exploration}{}{g:exploration:idp403343726752}%

\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343728368-back}{[Hint]}}\end{exploration}
Understanding the role of order in distinguishing outcomes often suggests the use of the quotient principle.  You might say we arrive at combinations by counting permutations and ``modding'' out by the order.  Each block that corresponds to a single combination is a group of permutations that are only different because of their order.  Let's see if we can apply this to other counting questions.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403343730640}%
The ice cream shop is down to only 3 flavors.  If you wanted a 3-scoop cone or a 3-scoop shake, made without repeated flavors, there would only be 6 cones possible and only 1 shake.  But what if you allowed repeated flavors?%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}How many 3-scoop cones are possible?%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343733024-back}{[Hint]}}\item{}How many 3-scoop shakes are there?  Write all of them down.%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343735152-back}{[Hint]}}\item{}Why doesn't the quotient principle apply here?  What goes wrong?%
\par
List out all 3-scoop cones and form the equivalence classes of shakes to see the issue.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
The previous activity illustrates that you cannot always simply apply the quotient principle to eliminate order mattering.  What we are after in the 3-scoop shakes with possibly repeated flavors is a \terminology{multiset}, which is just like a set only we allow for elements to be in the set multiple times, but we still do not care in what order the elements are listed.  So an example of an \(4\)-element multiset of \([7]\) is \(\{1,3,3,6\}\), which is the same multiset as \(\{1,6,3,3\}\) but different from the multiset \(\{1,3,6\}\) (in particular, this multiset only has three elements).%
\par
What we tried to do above was to count multisets by first counting sequences with possibly repeated elements, and then divide out by the number of sequences that just differ by the arrangement of a particular multiset.  But this didn't work, because the size of each block was not the same.%
\par
However, we would still like to be able to count the number of multisets.  How can we do this?  Is it an application of the quotient principle after all?  To start, let's establish some notation.  The number of \(k\)-element subsets of \([n]\) was given by \(n\) choose \(k\) (written \(\binom{n}{k}\)), so we will say that the number of \(k\)-element \emph{multisets} of \([n]\) will be \terminology{\(n\) multichoose \(k\)}, and write \(\mchoose{n}{k}\).  From what we have seen above, we can say,%
\begin{equation*}
\mchoose{n}{k} \ne \frac{n^k}{k!}
\end{equation*}
despite the obvious allure of this possibility.%
\par
Our question now is, what \emph{should} be in the numerator if not \(n^k\)?  First let's get more comfortable with thinking of multisets as a model for counting questions.%
\begin{activity}{}{x:activity:act_multisetintro}%
Explain why each of the following counting problems have an answer in the form \(\mchoose{n}{k}\) (say what \(n\) and \(k\) should be).  That is, show how each of them is counting the number of \(k\)-element multisets of \([n]\) (or a different set of size \(n\)).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]

\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
\begin{activity}{}{x:activity:act-distributionintro}%
Explain why each of the following counting problems are also answered in the form \(\mchoose{n}{k}\) (and say what \(n\) and \(k\) are).  You should be able to explain why all of these are equivalent to each other, and then find a bijection from any of them to the set of \(k\)-element multisets of \([n]\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]

\item{}How many ways can you put 10 identical books on the 4 shelves of a bookcase?  Assume each shelf could hold up to 10 books, and that all the books are always shoved all the way to the left (so we are not worried about where the books are on an individual shelf, just which shelf they go on).%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
The problems in \hyperref[x:activity:act-distributionintro]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:act-distributionintro}} are sometimes referred to as ``distribution problems'', since we are asking for the number of ways to distribute some objects to some recipients.   This is a useful model for the other counting techniques we have seen as well.  For example, a permutation \(P(n,k)\) gives the number of ways to distribute \(n\) distinct objects to \(k\) distinct recipients, so that each recipient gets exactly one object.%
\par
The claim implicit in \hyperref[x:activity:act-distributionintro]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:act-distributionintro}} is that the number of ways to distribute \(n\) identical objects to \(k\) distinct recipients (now allowing each recipient to receive any number of objects, including zero) is \(\mchoose{n}{k}\).  If this is the case, then we should be able to think of the set of \(k\)-element multisets of \([n]\) as a distribution.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403343775072}%
Consider \(3\)-element multisets of \([5]\).  One of these is \(\{1,1,1\}\), and another is \(\{2,4,5\}\).  How are these two multisets like distributing three objects among 5 recipients?  What are the objects that you are distributing?%
\end{activity}
Now let's consider a related distribution problem, where in some way, order now matters.  In fact, how is it that saying the distribution problems as in \hyperref[x:activity:act-distributionintro]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:act-distributionintro}} are ones for which order doesn't matter?  Look back at our standard example of order mattering or not:%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403343779328}%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}If \(P(n,k)\) counts the number of ways to distribute \(n\) distinct objects to \(k\) distinct recipients in which each recipient receives exactly one object (do you see why this is?), then what distribution does \(\binom{n}{k}\) count?  Explain what is playing the role of ``order mattering'' in a distribution problem.%
\item{}We claim that counting the number of ways to distribute \(n\) identical books to \(k\) distinct shelves is counted by \(\mchoose{n}{k}\), and this is a situation in which order does not matter (since we are counting multisets).  What would the distribution question be if order did matter?  Explain why the answer to that question is NOT \(n^k\). (What distribution does \emph{that} expression count?)%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
Consider the case where the books are distinct instead of identical.  Note also that in the next few activities, the usage of the variables \(k\) and \(n\) are reversed from above.  As you work through these next activities, think about why that choice was made.%
\begin{activity}{}{x:activity:bookcase}%
Suppose we wish to place \(k\) distinct books onto the shelves of a bookcase with \(n\) shelves. For simplicity, assume for now that all of the books would fit on any of the shelves. Also, let's imagine pushing the books on a shelf as far to the left as we can, so that we are only thinking about how the books sit relative to each other, not about the exact places where we put the books. Since the books are distinct, we can think of the first book, the second book and so on.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}How many places are there where we can place the first book?%
\item{}When we place the second book, if we decide to place it on the shelf that already has a book, does it matter if we place it to the left or right of the book that is already there?%
\item{}How many places are there where we can place the second book?%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343797632-back}{[Hint]}}\item{}Once we have \(i-1\) books placed, if we want to place book \(i\)  on a shelf that already has some books, is sliding it in to the left of all the books already there different from placing it to the right of all the books already or between two books already there?%
\item{}In how many ways may we place the \(i\)th book into the bookcase?%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343804736-back}{[Hint]}}\item{}In how many ways may we place all the books?%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
The assignment of which books go to which shelves of a bookcase is simply a function from the books to the shelves. But a function does not determine which book sits to the left of which others on the shelf, and this information is part of how the books are arranged on the shelves. In other words, the order in which the shelves receive their books matters.  Our function must thus assign an ordered list of books to each shelf. We will call such a function an ordered function. More precisely, an \terminology{ordered function}\index{ordered function}\index{function!ordered} from a set \(S\) to a set \(T\) is a function that assigns an (ordered) list of elements of \(S\) to some, but not necessarily all, elements of \(T\) in such a way that each element of \(S\) appears on one and only one of the lists.\footnote{The phrase ordered function is not a standard one, because there is as yet no standard name for the result of an ordered distribution problem.\label{g:fn:idp403343816624}}%
\par
We often think of functions as a rule that assigns an output to each input.  However, we could equally well specify a function by giving the complete inverse image of each element of the codomain.  That is, to define a (non-ordered) function \(f:S \to T\), we could give the set \(f\inv(t) = \{s \in S \st f(s) = t\}\) for each \(t \in T\).  The set of elements sent to \(t\) is a \emph{set} for a function, but for an ordered function, it is a \emph{sequence}.%
\begin{theorem}{}{}{g:theorem:idp403343820656}%
The number of ordered functions from a \(k\)-element set to an \(n\)-element set is%

\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
AHA!  The previous activity suggests that to count multisets, which is the same as counting distributions of identical objects to distinct recipients, we should apply the quotient principle to ordered functions.%
\par
What should the equivalence relation be?  Think about bookshelves.  An ordered function is a distribution of distinct books to distinct shelves.  A multiset is a distribution of identical books to distinct shelves.  So we want two ordered functions to be equivalent if their corresponding shelves contain the same number of books (we no longer care what those books are, just how many there are).%
\par
Now, given any ordered function, how many ordered functions are in its equivalence class?  We can get any other element in the class by permuting the books (but keeping the numbers in each shelf constant).  There are \(k\) books, so there are \(k!\) ways to permute them.  This is the same for \emph{every} ordered function, so the equivalence classes all have the same size.%
\par
Applying the quotient principle, we arrive at the following.%
\begin{theorem}{}{}{x:theorem:thm-multisetsize}%
The number of \(k\)-element multisets of \([n]\) is%
\begin{equation*}
\mchoose{n}{k} = \frac{P(n-1+k, k)}{k!} = \binom{n-1+k}{k}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{theorem}
It is interesting that the number of \(k\)-element multisets of \([n]\) can be expressed as a binomial coefficient.  This suggests there should be a way to describe a multiset as choosing \(k\) things from a collection of \(n-1+k\) things. Or perhaps thinking about each multiset as a \((n-1+k)\)-bit string of weight \(k\).%
\par
There is a standard interpretation for this.  We call this approach \terminology{stars and bars} (others use \emph{balls and wall} or \emph{dashes and slashes}; the important thing is that it rhymes).  The idea is that we represent each multiset as a string of \(k\) ``stars'' and \(n-1\) ``bars''.  These are really just bit strings in disguise, so the binomial coefficient becomes clear.  The only question is how do multisets correspond to the strings?%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403343853696}%
Consider \(4\)-element multisets of \([3]\).  Using the formula above, there are \(\binom{6}{4} = 15\) of these.  There are also \(\binom{6}{4}\) stars and bars strings using \(4\) stars and \(2\) bars.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}Write out all 15 multisets and all 15 stars and bars strings.  Find a bijection between these that makes sense.%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343858528-back}{[Hint]}}\item{}Why does it make sense that there are only 2 bars in these diagrams, but 3 elements that can go into the multiset?%
\item{}What would go wrong if we used 3 bars and 3 stars (that is, confused \(n\) and \(k\))?  Why does \(*||**|\) not make sense as a multiset here?%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
Thinking of these distribution problems as ``stars and bars problems'' can make solving them very quick.  The key step is deciding what part of the problem the stars correspond to, and what the bars correspond do.  The remaining exercises here should give you some practice with this.%
\begin{exploration}{}{g:exploration:idp403343864704}%
Each of the counting problems below can be solved with stars and bars. For each, say what outcome the string%
\begin{equation*}
***|*||**|
\end{equation*}
represents, if there are the correct number of stars and bars for the problem. Otherwise, say why the diagram does not represent any outcome, and what a correct diagram would look like.%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}How many ways are there to select a handful of 6 jellybeans from a jar that contains 5 different flavors?%
\item{}How many ways can you distribute 5 identical lollipops to 6 kids?%
\item{}How many 6-letter words can you make using the 5 vowels in increasing order?%

Now solve each of these using stars and bars and the formula in \hyperref[x:theorem:thm-multisetsize]{Theorem~\ref{x:theorem:thm-multisetsize}}.  Be sure to clearly state which part of the problem corresponds to the stars and which to the bars, and why this makes sense.%

Both multisets and ordered functions allowed some of the recipients to receive nothing (or for some elements of \([n]\) to not be included in the multiset).  What if we didn't want to allow this?%

Suppose we wish to place the books in \hyperref[x:activity:bookcase]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:bookcase}} (satisfying the assumptions we made there) so that each shelf gets at least one book.

The previous activity is an example of what we might call an \terminology{ordered surjection}.  Just like we did with ordered functions, we can apply the quotient principle to count distributions where the objects being distributed are no longer distinct.%

Namely, the number of books on shelf \(i\) is the \(i\)th element of the list. Thus the number of compositions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts is \(\binom{k-1}{n-1}\).%
\end{example}
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403343924416}%
The answer in \hyperref[x:example:compositionagian]{Example~\ref{x:example:compositionagian}} can be expressed as a binomial coefficient. This means it should be possible to interpret a composition as a subset of some set. Find a bijection between compositions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts and certain subsets of some set.

If we choose \(n-1\) of these places and slip dividers into those places, then we have a first clump of books, a second clump of books, and so on. The \(i\)th element of our list is the number of books in the \(i\)th clump. Clearly using books is irrelevant; we could line up any \(k\) identical objects and make the same argument. Our bijection is between compositions and \((n-1)\)-element subsets of the set of \(k-1\) spaces between our objects.%

\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
So far, we have only considered distribution problems in which the recipients are distinct.  There are plenty of situations where we would want to consider recipients identical.  For example, a problem we will take up in \hyperref[x:chapter:ch_advanced]{Chapter~\ref{x:chapter:ch_advanced}} is how many ways we can partition an integer.  For example, we could partition 5 as \(4+1\) or \(3+1+1\), but we would not want to also count \(1+4\) or \(1+3+1\) (doing so would be creating a \emph{composition}, which we have already considered).  We can think of the integer partition problem as distributing the 5 units that make up 5 into some number of identical bins.%
\par
Here is another example, which we already have the tools to address.%
\begin{exploration}{}{x:exploration:brokenpermutation}%
In how many ways may we stack \(k\) distinct books into \(n\) identical boxes so that there is a stack in every box? There are two distinct ways to answer this question.  Find them both.%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343953184-back}{[Hint]}}\end{exploration}
We can think of stacking books into identical boxes as partitioning the books and then ordering the blocks of the partition. This turns out not to be a useful computational way of visualizing the problem because the number of ways to order the books in the various stacks depends on the sizes of the stacks and not just the number of stacks. However this way of thinking actually led to the first hint in \hyperref[x:exploration:brokenpermutation]{Exercise~\ref{x:exploration:brokenpermutation}}. Instead of dividing a set up into non-overlapping parts, we may think of dividing a \emph{permutation} (thought of as a list) of our \(k\) objects up into \(n\) ordered blocks. We will say that a set of ordered lists of elements of a set \(S\) is a \terminology{broken permutation} \index{broken permutation} \index{permutation!broken} of \(S\) if each element of \(S\) is in one and only one of these lists.\footnote{The phrase broken permutation is not standard, because there is no standard name for the solution to this kind  of distribution problem.\label{g:fn:idp403343968128}} The number of broken permutations of a \(k\)-element set with \(n\) blocks is denoted by \(L(k,n)\). The number \(L(k,n)\) is called a \terminology{Lah Number} and, from our solution to \hyperref[x:exploration:brokenpermutation]{Exercise~\ref{x:exploration:brokenpermutation}}, is equal to \(k!\binom{k-1}{n-1}/n!\).\index{Lah number}%
\par
The Lah numbers are the solution to the question ``In how many ways may we distribute \(k\) distinct objects to \(n\) identical recipients if order matters and each recipient must get at least one?''%

\begin{introduction}{}%
What happens when you get stuck on a counting problem?  It is quite easy to miss the clever way of thinking about breaking down a task that leads to a solution.  Here is an example.%
\par
Your favorite milk-shake diner has 11 stools along the bar.  Patrons of the diner have a rule that no two adjacent stools can be simultaneously occupied.  In how many ways can the stools be occupied by any number of patrons (including no patrons at all, leaving all stools unoccupied)?%
\par
A first attempt might be to start with stool 1 and realize that it can be sat on or not.  So there are two choices for stool 1.  But now you might have two choices for stool 2 (if stool 1 was not sat on) or only once choice (to keep stool 2 empty, if stool 1 was in use).  Okay, so the multiplicative principle doesn't help.%
\par
Say you can't think of anything else to try.  The problem seems just too hard.  So make it easier:  11 is way too big of a number; 1 would be much better.  How many ways could a row of 1 stool be occupied?  Let's call this number \(S_1\).  Maybe then we also try the version with 2 and 3 stools.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403343979840}%
List all stool seating charts with 1, 2, and 3 stools.  Let the number of seating charts be called \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively.  Do you notice a pattern among these numbers?%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343983824-back}{[Hint]}}\end{activity}
We get a sequence \((S_n)_{n \ge 1}\) which gives the number of seating charts.%
\par
The sequence we get is \(2, 3, 5, 8, 13, \ldots\).  It \emph{appears} that this sequence satisfies a familiar recurrence relation of the \terminology{Fibonacci sequence}: \(S_n = S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}\).  But unlike the Fibonacci sequence, here the initial terms are \(S_1 = 2\) and \(S_2 = 3\).  Is this appearance deceiving?  Can we explain why this sequence should satisfy this recurrence?%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403343990464}%
Explain why \(S_n\) satisfies the recurrence \(S_n = S_{n-1} + S_{n-2}\).  You will need to consider seating charts with \(n\), \(n-1\) and \(n-2\) stools.  Show how you can ``find'' the seating charts for \(n-1\) and \(n-2\) stools among those for \(n\) stools (perhaps using some sort of bijection).%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403343995424-back}{[Hint]}}\end{activity}
Once we have a proof that our sequence really does give the answers to all the versions of the counting question we are interested in, then  we can start investigating properties of this sequence.  Sometimes, we might even be able to find a closed formula for the \(n\)th term of the sequence, so we can compute values without relying on the recurrence.%

%
\begin{subsectionptx}{Finding Recurrence Relations}{}{Finding Recurrence Relations}{}{}{x:subsection:subsec-recursionfinding}
Before investigating properties of sequences given by recurrence relations, we must be able to find those sequences and the recurrence relations.  The following activities give some practice with moving from a counting question to a recurrence relation for the sequence of answers.  You might be able to answer the counting questions with what we have already discovered, but do not do this.  The point of these is to start thinking about these counting problems recursively.%
\par
First, here is an example of what we are looking for.%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403344000512}%
Let \(a_n\) be the number of subsets of \([n]\).  Find a recurrence relation for the sequence \((a_n)_{n \ge 0}\).  Prove the recurrence relation is correct.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403344003104}{}\quad{}Start by enumerating the sequence \((a_n)_{n \ge 0}\).  There is only 1 subset of the empty set (so \(a_0 = 1\)).  There are two subsets of \([1]\), and four subsets of \([2]\).  So the sequence looks like \(1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots\).  It \emph{appears} that the recurrence relation should be \(a_n = 2a_{n-1}\) with initial condition \(a_0 = 1\).%
\par
To prove this is correct, we \emph{must} reference the things we are counting (saying that the recurrence agrees with the finitely many terms we have listed is NOT enough).  Consider the \(a_{n-1}\) different subsets of \([n-1]\).  Each of these is a subset of \([n]\), in particular, a subset of \([n]\) that does not include the number \(n\) as an element.  Further, to each of these sets, we can add the element \(n\) to get another distinct subset of \([n]\).  So far, we have found \(2a_{n-1}\) subsets of \([n]\).  Actually, we have found all of them: every subset of \([n]\) either includes \(n\) or it does not.%
\end{example}
Now here are some for you to try.%
\begin{exploration}{}{g:exploration:idp403344014544}%
Let \(k_n\) be the number of handshakes that take place if all \(n\) people in a room shake hands with everyone there exactly once.  Find a recurrence relation for the sequence \((k_n)_{n \ge 1}\) and prove you are correct.%

\begin{exploration}{}{g:exploration:idp403344018224}%

\begin{exploration}{}{x:exploration:HanoiProblem}%
The ``Towers of Hanoi'' puzzle has three rods rising from a rectangular base with \(n\) rings of different sizes stacked in decreasing order of size on one rod. A legal move consists of moving a ring from one rod to another so that it does not land on top of a smaller ring. If \(m_n\) is the number of moves required to move all the rings from the initial rod to another rod that you choose, give a recurrence for \(m_n\).%

\begin{exploration}{}{x:exploration:circlesinplane}%
We draw \(n\) mutually intersecting circles in the plane so that each one crosses each other one exactly twice and no three intersect in the same point. (As examples, think of Venn diagrams with two or three mutually intersecting sets.) Find a recurrence for the number \(r_n\) of regions into which the plane is divided by \(n\) circles. (One circle divides the plane into two regions, the inside and the outside.) Find the number of regions with \(n\) circles. For what values of \(n\) can you draw a Venn diagram showing all the possible intersections of \(n\) sets using circles to represent each of the sets?%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403344037440-back}{[Hint]}}\end{exploration}
The sequences above all have relatively simple recurrence relations.  In particular, the recursions all make reference only to one previous term.  This need not be the case, as we saw when counting bar stool seating charts and as the next few problems demonstrate.%
\begin{exploration}{}{x:exploration:act-dominoes}%
Suppose you have a large number of \(1\times 1\) squares and \(1 \times 2\) dominoes.  You wish to use these to tile a \(1 \times n\) path.

While it is often easier to find a recurrence relation governing a sequence, if we wish to use sequences to solve counting problems, we would really like to be able to find a closed formula for the terms in a sequence. If this is not possible, we can still use the recurrence relation to learn something about how the sequence behaves.%
\par
We will start by consider some simple classes of recurrence relations for which we can find closed formulas.%
\begin{activity}{}{x:activity:act-arithmetic}%
Let \((a_n)_{n \le 0}\) satisfy \(a_n = a_{n-1} + 3\) with \(a_0 = 2\).  For example, \(a_n\) might give the number of push-ups you can do \(n\) days into your training, assuming you can do 3 more push-ups each day, if you could do 2 push-ups before you started training.  Find a closed formula for \(a_n\) and justify your answer.  Show how the recurrence relation is used.%

\begin{activity}{}{x:activity:act-geometric}%
Let \((a_n)_{n \le 0}\) satisfy \(a_n = 3a_{n-1}\) with \(a_0 = 2\).  For example, \(a_n\) might give the number of \(n\)-scoop ice-cream cones you can make from 3 available flavors in one of two kinds of cones.  Find a closed formula for \(a_n\) and justify your answer.  Show how the recurrence relation is used.%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403344105024-back}{[Hint]}}\end{activity}
The sequence in \hyperref[x:activity:act-arithmetic]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:act-arithmetic}} is an example of an \terminology{arithmetic sequence} (or arithmetic progression) in that the difference between terms is constant.  The sequence in \hyperref[x:activity:act-geometric]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:act-geometric}} is an example of a \terminology{geometric sequence} (or geometric progression) because the \emph{ratio} between terms is constant.  Of course there is nothing special about 2 and 3 in the activities, so you should now see how to find the closed formula for any arithmetic or geometric sequence.%
\par
The techniques used to get those closed formulas are also worth pointing out.  The method suggested in the hint to \hyperref[x:activity:act-arithmetic]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:act-arithmetic}} is called \terminology{telescoping} and the method suggested for \hyperref[x:activity:act-geometric]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:act-geometric}} is called \terminology{iteration}.%
\par
Most sequences are not arithmetic, but it is still helpful to look at the difference between terms.  Often if we know something about the sequence of differences, we can deduce something about the original sequence.   We can also think about this as starting with the sequence of differences.%
\par
Given any sequence \((a_n)_{n \ge 1}\), we can form the \terminology{sequence of partial sums} \((b_n)_{n \ge 1}\) given by \(b_n = \sum_{i = 1}^n a_n\).  That is, \(b_n\) tells you what you get if you add up the first \(n\) terms of \((a_n)\).%
\par
Note that \((b_n)\) satisfies the recurrence relation \(b_n = b_{n-1} + a_n\), or equivalently \(b_n - b_{n-1} = a_n\).  So \((a_n)\) is the sequence of differences of its sequence of partial sums!%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403344120592}%

The right hand side contains \(n\) summands, all identical, so \(2T_n = n(n+1)\).  Divide by 2!%

Notice also that these triangular numbers appear as the third diagonal of Pascal's triangle.  That is, \(T_n = \binom{n+1}{2}\).  Using the factorial formula for \(\binom{n+1}{2}\) confirms this.%

The sequences in the previous problem worked out nicely, but what can we say in general?  Here are a few things.%

Let \((a_n)_{n \ge 1}\) be any arithmetic sequence.  Say \(a_n = dn + c\) (so \(d\) is the common difference and \(c = a_1 - d = a_0\), if \(a_0\) were part of the sequence).  What can we say about the closed formula for \(b_n = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i\)?%

Why is that helpful?  What is the sum?%

\item{}What is special about sums of arithmetic sequences that allows you to do this computation?  Explain.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
The previous activity shows that the sequence of partial sums of an arithmetic sequence is always a quadratic sequence.  Conversely, any quadratic sequence should arise in this way.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403344202864}%
Given a sequence \((b_n)_{n \ge 1}\) with a quadratic closed formula, say \(b_n = an^2 + bn + c\), what will the closed formula for the sequence of differences be?  That is, what is the closed formula for \(a_n = b_n - b_{n-1}\)?  Why does this show that every quadratic sequence is the sequence of partial sums for some arithmetic sequence?%
\end{activity}
The above observations can be generalized: a cubic sequence will have quadratic difference, a quartic sequence will have cubic differences, and so on.  This allows us to guess at the \emph{form} of a closed formula for a polynomial sequence by taking successive differences.  If the ``third differences'' of a sequence are constant, then we would guess we could find a cubic polynomial.  Given the first 4 terms, we can fit the cubic to them by setting up a system of 4 equations and 4 unknowns.%
\par
Sequences of partial sums are also useful for geometric sequences.  The following technique will likely be familiar from calculus when you worked with geometric series.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403344207952}%
What is \(3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + \cdots + 12288\)?  Call the sum \(S\) and compute \(S - 2S\).%
\end{activity}
To better see what happened in the above example, try writing it this way:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0}{0}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{1}%
{\centering%
\begin{tabular}{rlll}
\(S=\)&\(3 \, +\)&\(6 + 12 + 24 + \cdots + 12288\)&\tabularnewline[0pt]
\(- \qquad 2S=\)&&\(6 + 12 + 24 + \cdots + 12288\)&\(+ 24576\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(-S = \)&\(3 \, +\)&\(0 + 0 + 0 +  \cdots + 0 \)&\(-24576\)
\end{tabular}
\par}
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
Then divide both sides by \(-1\) and we have the same result for \(S\). The idea is, by multiplying the sum by the common ratio, each term becomes the next term. We shift over the sum to get the subtraction to mostly cancel out, leaving just the first term and new last term.%

Here is a surprising use of these geometric sums to answer a counting question:%
\begin{exploration}{}{g:exploration:idp403344255968}%
How many license plates consist of 6 symbols, using only the three numerals 1, 2, and 3 and the four letters a, b, c, and d, so that no numeral appears after any letter?  For example, ``31ddac'' and ``12321'' are acceptable license plates, but ``13ba2c'' is not.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}First answer this question by considering different cases: how many of the license plates contain no numerals?  How many contain one numeral, etc.  Find the sum.%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403344259792-back}{[Hint]}}\item{}Recognize that that the total \(S\) when written this way is the sum of a (finite) geometric sequence.  Compute \(S - \frac{3}{4}S\) to conclude that the answer can be expressed as \(4^7 - 3^7\).%
\item{}Generalize! What if a license plate has \(n\) symbols?%
\end{enumerate}
\end{exploration}
Guessing the form of a closed formula is also reasonable when we believe a sequence to be exponential.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403344265472}%
Consider the recurrence relation \(a_n = 5a_{n-1} - 6a_{n-2}\).  Listing terms (with some reasonable initial conditions) suggests that this sequence grows exponentially.%

\item{}Might there be another solution to the recurrence relation?  Suppose \(a_n = r^n\) for some non-zero constant \(r\).  Show that \(r = 2\) or \(r = 3\).%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403344275744-back}{[Hint]}}\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
This is a partial justification of the \terminology{characteristic root technique} (the polynomial whose roots are the base of the exponentials is called the \terminology{characteristic polynomial}).  Making the reasonable guess that recurrence relations which give \(a_n\) as a linear combination of \(a_{n-1}\) and \(a_{n-2}\) should have exponential closed formulas allows you to find the bases of those exponentials.  You can then use the initial conditions to find the constants \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\).  Let's illustrate this process with an example.%
\begin{example}{}{x:example:eg_char-roots}%
Find a closed formula for the sequence \((a_n)_{n \ge 1}\) given recursively by \(a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 4a_{n-2}\) with initial conditions \(a_1 = 3\) and \(a_2 = 13\).  (This is the sequence of colorful square\slash{}domino paths from \hyperref[x:exploration:act-dominoes]{Exercise~\ref{x:exploration:act-dominoes}}.)%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403344285744}{}\quad{}From the recurrence relation we have \(a_n - 3a_{n-1} - 4a_{n-2} = 0\).  We transform this into the characteristic equation \(x^2 - 3x - 4 = 0\). This has roots \(x = 4\) and \(x = -1\).  So we guess that the closed formula for \(a_n\) will be \(a_n = \alpha 4^n + \beta (-1)^n\).%
\par
To find \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), we use the initial conditions.   When \(n = 1\) we have \(3 = 4\alpha -\beta\).  When \(n = 2\) we have \(13 = 16\alpha + \beta\).  It is easy to solve this system of two equations and two unknowns (simply adding them together eliminates the \(\beta\)).  We find \(\alpha = \frac{4}{5}\) and \(\beta = \frac{1}{5}\).%
\par
Thus the closed formula is%
\begin{equation*}
a_n = \frac{4}{5} 4^n + \frac{1}{5} (-1)^n\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{example}

There are many subtle and interesting variations on solving recurrence relations, and we will not explore them all here.  To conclude though, we consider one interesting case that will show up later as well.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403344305632}%

\item{}What goes wrong when you (blindly) apply the characteristic root technique?%
\item{}Write out the first few terms of the sequence to guess at the closed formula.  Verify it is correct.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
As you saw above, something goes wrong with the characteristic root technique when the roots of the characteristic equation are repeated.  One way around this is to guess that the closed formula should be%
\begin{equation*}
a_n = \alpha r^n + \beta nr^n\text{,}
\end{equation*}
where \(r\) is the repeated root and \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are constants determined by the initial conditions as normal. The key here is to add an extra multiple of \(n\) to the second term.%

Even though we are thinking of sequences as a tool for solving counting questions, it is often very rewarding to step back and observe the beauty and elegance of a sequence in its own right.  So to conclude this section, we will consider a few delightful observations about the most famous recursively defined sequence: the Fibonacci numbers.%
\par
For consistency, let's agree that \(F_n\) is the \(n\)th Fibonacci number, where \(F_0 = 0\) and \(F_1 = 1\), and for all other \(n\), \(F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}\).%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403344327536}%
Determine a formula for the sum \(F_{0} + F_{1} + F_{2} + \ldots + F_{n}\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403344329088}{}\quad{}If we collect some initial data we see that the sequence of partial sums is \(0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 12, 20, \ldots\).  We might recognize these numbers as always one less than a Fibonacci number, and guess that%
\begin{equation*}
F_0 + F_1 + F_2 + \cdot + F_n = F_{n+2} - 1.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
We could prove this by induction, but for fun, here is a clever observation that finishes the problem: \(F_k = F_{k+2} - F_{k+1}\) (just rearrange the recurrence relation).  Now replace each term after \(F_0\):%
\begin{equation*}
F_0 + (F_3 - F_2) + (F_4 - F_3) + (F_5 - F_4) + \cdots + (F_{n+1} - F_n)+ (F_{n+2} - F_{n+1})\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Almost every term cancels (telescopes) leaving only%
\begin{equation*}
-F_1 + F_{n+2}
\end{equation*}
which is of course what we are looking for.%

You were asked above to prove the following \terminology{Binet formula}:%
\begin{equation*}
F_n = \frac{a^n-b^n}{a-b}
\end{equation*}
where \(a\) and \(b\) are the roots of \(x^2 - x - 1\).  The next example shows an interesting use of this formula.%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403344362976}%
Prove \(\binom{n}{0}F_{0} + \binom{n}{1}F_{1} + \ldots + \binom{n}{n}F_{n} = F_{2n}\) in two ways.  First, use the Binet Formula from \hyperref[x:exploration:act-binet]{Exercise~\ref{x:exploration:act-binet}}.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403344365136}{}\quad{}Starting on the right side, use the Binet formula and the fact that \(a\) and \(b\) satisfy \(x^2 - x - 1 = 0\):%
\begin{equation*}
F_{2n} = \frac{a^{2n} - b^{2n}}{a-b} = \frac{(a+1)^n - (b+1)^n}{a-b}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Then expand the two binomials using the binomial theorem:%
\begin{equation*}
F_{2n} = \frac{\binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1}a + \cdots + \binom{n}{n}a^n - \left[\binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1}b + \cdots + \binom{n}{n}b^n\right]}{a-b}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Now group like terms:%
\begin{align*}
F_{2n} = \amp \binom{n}{0}\frac{a^0-b^0}{a-b} + \binom{n}{1}\frac{a-b}{a-b} + \binom{n}{2}\frac{a^2-b^2}{a-b}+\cdots + \binom{n}{n}\frac{a^n-b^n}{a-b} \\
= \amp \binom{n}{0}F_0 + \binom{n}{1}F_1 + \cdots + \binom{n}{n}F_n \text{.}
\end{align*}

\begin{subsectionptx}{The Catalan Numbers}{}{The Catalan Numbers}{}{}{x:subsection:subsec-catalanseq}
The sequence of Catalan numbers, named after Eugene Catalan who along with Euler discovered many of the properties of these numbers, is the sequence \((C_n)_{n \ge 0}\) starting,%
\begin{equation*}
1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, \ldots\text{.}
\end{equation*}
All of the counting problems above should be answered by Catalan numbers.  Let's investigate this sequence and discover some of its properties.%
\par
First, we should make sure that at the very least, all of the counting problems above have the same answer.  This will be hugely helpful, since then we could use any of them as a model to discuss the sequence.%
\par
How do you prove that two counting problems have the same answer?  The bijection principle tells us that if there is a bijection between two sets, then the sets have the same size.  So let's find some bijections.%
\begin{example}{}{x:example:act-pathshdseq}%
Find a bijection between the set of lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((n,n)\) that do not rise above the line \(y = x\) (as in \hyperref[x:activity:act-lowerpaths]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:act-lowerpaths}}) and the set of ways that the movie patrons in \hyperref[x:activity:act-hdseq]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:act-hdseq}} can line up.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403344497056}{}\quad{}Represent each lattice path as a string of R's and U's.  Represent each way that the movie patrons can line up as a string of H's and D's.  The bijection will send each R to an H and each U to a D.%
\par
We need to verify that this bijection is both well defined, and that its inverse is well defined (that the function is injective and surjective).  The key to all of these is to consider what makes a string valid in each case.%
\par
First, notice that the lattice paths must have an equal number of R's and U's.  Similarly, the string of movie patrons must have an equal number of H's and D's. Further, every initial substring of R's and U's must have at least as many R's as U's, so that the path does not go above the line \(y=x\).  Similarly, the every initial substring of H's and D's (half dollars and dollars) must have at least as many H's as D's, so that change can always be given.  The H's and R's must \emph{dominate}.%
\par
The the conditions on what makes a string valid match up, so every string in one set will match up with exactly one string in the other.%
\end{example}
Representing the set of outcomes as strings of sequences is useful, because it suggests a bijection between different types of problems.  The strings of paths and movie theater lines from \hyperref[x:example:act-pathshdseq]{Example~\ref{x:example:act-pathshdseq}} are called \terminology{Dyck words}.  These are strings of an equal number of two symbols, say \(x\) and \(y\), such that no initial segment of the string has more \(y\)'s than \(x\)'s.%
\par
We will now see that the number of Dyck words of length \(2n\) is \(C_n\).%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403344505760}%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}Show that the number of acceptable tableau insertions from \hyperref[x:activity:act-tableau]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:act-tableau}} is always a Catalan number.  That is, give a bijection between the set of Dyck words of length \(2n\) to the set of ways to insert the numbers 1 through \(2n\) into a \(2\times n\) tableau so that both rows and columns are increasing.%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403344509136-back}{[Hint]}}\item{}Show the number of ways to parenthesize a product of \(n+1\) numbers is \(C_n\) (see \hyperref[x:activity:act-parenthesize]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:act-parenthesize}}).%

We have now verified that all our sample problems are Catalan numbers, except for the triangulations of polygons problem.  There is a clever way to associate each triangulation with a binary tree, as suggested by \hyperref[x:figure:fig-triangulationtree]{Figure~\ref{x:figure:fig-triangulationtree}}.  However, let's take this opportunity to illustrate another method for proving two problems have the same answers.%

Next, we would like to find a closed formula for \(C_n\).  We can do so using lattice paths.%

\item{}Find a bijection between lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((n,n)\) that touch (or cross) the line \(y=x+1\) and lattice paths from \((-1,1)\) to \((n,n)\).%

So \(C_n = \binom{2n}{n} - \binom{2n}{n+1}\).  Another formula you might run into is \(C_n = \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}\).  Why is this also correct?%

\begin{introduction}{}%
The combinatorics we have investigated so far has been \emph{nice}.  While not always immediately obvious, each problem had an answer in a nice form that, once you saw how to think about it the right way, could be expressed with a closed formula.%
\par
Not all of combinatorics is like this.  There are natural questions for which we do not have neat closed formulas.  This might be because we (mathematicians) have not yet figured out how to think about these problems in the ``right'' way, or because there is really no clean approach to solve these problems.%
\par
But lack of clean solutions does not mean the problems have no answer.  Rather, we must simply look for more abstract techniques before we can get any hold on them.%
\par
The plan for this chapter is as follows.  We will start with two combinatorial tools.  First, the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion  and then generating functions.   We will then consider some natural extensions of distribution problems first introduced in \hyperref[x:section:sec_basic-quotient]{Section~\ref{x:section:sec_basic-quotient}}: partitioning sets and integers.%

One of our very first counting principles was the \terminology{sum principle}\index{sum principle} which says that the size of a union of disjoint sets is the sum of their sizes. Computing the size of overlapping sets requires, quite naturally, information about how they overlap. Taking such information into account will allow us to develop a powerful extension of the sum principle known as the ``principle of inclusion and exclusion.''\index{principle of inclusion and exclusion}\index{inclusion and exclusion principle}%

The difficulty of generalizing \hyperref[x:activity:threesetintersection]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:threesetintersection}} and \hyperref[x:activity:nsetintersection]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:nsetintersection}} is not likely to be one of being able to see what the right conjecture is, but of finding a good notation to express your conjecture. In fact, it would be easier for some people to express the conjecture in words than to express it in a notation. Here is some notation that will make your task easier. Let us define%
\begin{equation*}
\bigcap_{i:i\in I}A_i
\end{equation*}
to mean the intersection over all elements \(i\) in the set \(I\) of \(A_i\). Thus%
\begin{equation}
\bigcap_{i:i\in
\{1,3,4,6\}} = A_1\cap A_3\cap A_4 \cap A_6.\label{x:men:intersectionnotation}
\end{equation}
%
\par
This kind of notation, consisting of an operator with a description underneath of the values of a dummy variable of interest to us, can be extended in many ways. For example%
\begin{align}
\sum_{I:I \subseteq \{1,2,3,4\}, \ |I|=2} |\cap_{i\in I}
A_i|  \amp =  |A_1\cap A_2|+ |A_1\cap A_3|
+|A_1\cap A_4|\notag\\
\amp +  |A_2\cap A_3|+
|A_2\cap A_4| +|A_3\cap A_4|.\label{x:mrow:notationsolution}

Note there are many different correct ways to do this problem. Try to write down more than one and choose the nicest one you can.

Whether we try to write down a nice expression for the size of a union or whether we just have the basic idea, we should now be able to answer counting questions like the following.  We will return to this sort of problem in more detail later, but the adventurous reader can attempt it here.%
\begin{exploration}{}{x:exploration:hatcheck}%
A group of \(n\) students goes to a restaurant carrying backpacks. The manager invites everyone to check their backpack at the check desk and everyone does. While they are eating, a child playing in the check room randomly moves around the claim check stubs on the backpacks. We will try to compute the probability that, at the end of the meal, at least one student receives his or her own backpack.  This probability is the fraction of the total number of ways to return the backpacks in which at least one student gets his or her own backpack back.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]

\hyperref[x:exploration:hatcheck]{Exercise~\ref{x:exploration:hatcheck}} is ``classically'' called the \terminology{hatcheck problem}\index{hatcheck problem}; the name comes from substituting hats for backpacks. If is also sometimes called the \terminology{derangement problem}\index{derangement problem}. A \terminology{derangement}\index{derangement} of an \(n\)-element set is a permutation of that set (thought of as a bijection) that maps no element of the set to itself. One can think of a way of handing back the backpacks as a permutation \(f\) of the students: \(f(i)\) is the owner of the backpack that student \(i\) receives. Then a derangement is a way to pass back the backpacks so that no student gets his or her own.%

\begin{subsectionptx}{The Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion}{}{The Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion}{}{}{g:subsection:idp403344764032}
The formula you have given in \hyperref[x:exploration:inclusion-exclusionunion]{Exercise~\ref{x:exploration:inclusion-exclusionunion}} is often called \terminology{the principle of inclusion and exclusion}\index{inclusion and exclusion principle!for unions of sets}\index{principle of inclusion and exclusion!for unions of sets} for unions of sets. The reason is the pattern in which the formula first adds (includes) all the sizes of the sets, then subtracts (excludes) all the sizes of the intersections of two sets, then adds (includes) all the sizes of the intersections of three sets, and so on.   Notice that we haven't yet proved the principle. There are a variety of proofs.  Perhaps one of the most straightforward (though not the most elegant) is an inductive proof that relies on the fact that%
\begin{equation*}
A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_n = \left(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_{n-1}\right) \cup A_n
\end{equation*}
and the formula for the size of a union of two sets: \(\card{A \cup B} = \card{A} + \card{B} - \card{A\cap B}\).%
\begin{exploration}{}{g:exploration:idp403344769280}%
Give a proof of your formula for the principle of inclusion and exclusion.%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403344770416-back}{[Hint]}}\end{exploration}
Frequently when we apply the principle of inclusion and exclusion, we will have a situation like that of part (d) of \hyperref[x:task:hatcheckprobpart]{Task~\ref{x:exploration:hatcheck}.\ref{x:task:hatcheckprobpart}}.  That is, we will have a set \(A\) and subsets \(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n\) and we will want the size or the probability of the set of elements in \(A\) that are \emph{not} in the union.  This set is known as the \terminology{complement} \index{complement} of the union of the \(A_i\)s in \(A\), and is denoted by \(A \setminus \bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i\), or if \(A\) is clear from context, by \(\overline{\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i}\).%
\par
Since all the \(A_i\)s are subsets of \(A\), one way to write this size is as \(|A| - \sum_{S:S \subseteq [n], S \ne \emptyset}(-1)^{|S|-1} |\bigcap_{i:i \in S}A_i|\).  Letting \(|A| = \left|\bigcap_{i:i \in \emptyset} A_i\right|\), we may write \(\left|\overline{\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i}\right| = \sum_{S:S \subseteq [n]} (-1)^{|S|}\left| \bigcap_{i:i\in S} A_i\right|\).%
\par
The principle of inclusion and exclusion generally refers to both this formula and the one for the union.  Both formulas are notationally horrific, but the idea is straight forward.  To find the size of the union, we add the sizes of each set individually, then subtract each of the sizes of the intersections of pairs of sets, then add back in the sizes of the intersections of triples of sets, subtract 4-tuple intersections, add 5-tuple intersections, and so on until we are done.  The compliment can be calculated by subtracting the union from the size of the original set.%

\begin{paragraphs}{Counting Derangements.}{x:paragraphs:subsec_derangements}%
A \terminology{derangement}\index{derangement} of \(n\) elements \(\{1,2,3,\ldots, n\}\) is a permutation in which no element is fixed. For example, there are \(6\) permutations of the three elements \(\{1,2,3\}\):%
\begin{equation*}
123 ~~ 132 ~~ 213 ~~ 231 ~~ 312 ~~ 321.
\end{equation*}
but most of these have one or more elements fixed: \(123\) has all three elements fixed since all three elements are in their original positions, \(132\) has the first element fixed (1 is in its original first position), and so on. In fact, the only derangements of three elements are%
\begin{equation*}
231 \text{ and } 312.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
If we go up to 4 elements, there are \(4! = 24\) permutations. How many of these are derangements? If you list out all 24 permutations and eliminate those which are not derangements, you will be left with just 9 derangements. Let's see how we can get that number using PIE.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403344873712}%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}Write out all 24 permutations of \([4]\) and circle the 9 that are derangements.%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403344875504-back}{[Hint]}}\item{}Locate the permutations that leave 1 fixed (so 1 is the first number in the permutation).  How many are there, and does this make sense?  Check there are an equal number that leave 2 fixed, and that leave 3 fixed, and that leave 4 fixed.%
\item{}Notice that there are permutations that leave both 1 and 2 fixed.  Which ones are these, and how many are there?  Again, verify that there are just as many that leave any pair of numbers fixed.%
\item{}Repeat the previous task for triples of elements fixed and for all four elements fixed.%
\item{}We can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the total number of derangements as follows:%
\begin{equation*}
d_4 = 4! - \left[{4 \choose 1}3! - {4 \choose 2}2! + {4 \choose 3} 1! - {4 \choose 4}0!\right].
\end{equation*}
Explain why this is correct.  In particular, for the permutation 1234 (where everything is fixed), where in the expression above is it counted?%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
Of course we can use a similar formula to count the derangements of any number of elements. However, the more elements we have, the longer the formula gets. Here is another example:%
\begin{exploration}{}{g:exploration:idp403344889376}%
Five gentlemen attend a party, leaving their hats at the door. At the end of the party, they hastily grab hats on their way out. How many different ways could this happen so that none of the gentlemen leave with their own hat?%
\end{exploration}
Derangments are interesting in their own right.  In \hyperref[x:section:sec_basic-proofs]{Section~\ref{x:section:sec_basic-proofs}} you proved a few results using combinatorial proofs.  In particular, we established the following, which you might try to prove again here.%
\begin{theorem}{}{}{x:theorem:thm-derangement-recursion}%
Let \(d_n\) denote the number of derangments of \(n\), with \(d_0 = 1\) and \(d_1 = 0\).  Then \(d_n = (n-1)(d_{n-1}+d_{n-2})\).%
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}{}{}{x:theorem:thm-derangment-sum}%
Let \(d_n\) denote the number of derangments of \(n\), with \(d_0 = 1\) and \(d_1 = 0\).  Then%
\begin{equation*}
\binom{n}{0}d_0 + \binom{n}{1}d_1 + \binom{n}{2}d_2 + \cdots + \binom{n}{n}d_n = n!
\end{equation*}
%
\end{theorem}
Here is another recursion you can explore.%
\begin{exploration}{}{g:exploration:idp403344902464}%
Use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to derive the recursion%
\begin{equation*}
d_n = nd_{n-1} + (-1)^n\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{exploration}
The non-recursive formula for derangments is messy due to the use of the principle of inclusion and exclusion.  Actually, it can be cleaned up a bit, which leads to a remarkable result.%
\begin{exploration}{}{g:exploration:idp403344904816}%

\item{}Generalize the previous part to give a nice clean expression for \(d_n\).%

There are six surjective functions  \(f:[3]\to [2]\), which happens to be \(2^3 - 2\).  This makes sense because there are eight functions all together, but two are not surjective (do you see why?).%
\par
Consider functions \(f:[3]\to [3]\).  Since each element of the domain has three potential images, there are \(3^3\) such functions.  If we only count the injective (one-to-one) functions, we will find \(3! = 6\).  Since the size of the domain and codomain are equal, this is also the number of surjective functions (since every injective function is surjective in this case).%
\par
However, when the size of the codomain is larger than the size of the domain, there will be no injections and plenty of surjections.  To see how to count surjections in general, let's explore the case above where we know the answer already.%

Suppose you are going to choose three pieces of fruit from among apples, pears and bananas for a snack.  We can symbolically represent all your choices as%
\begin{equation*}
\ap\ap\ap+\pe\pe\pe+\ba\ba\ba+\ap\ap\pe+\ap\ap\ba+\ap\pe\pe +\pe\pe\ba
+\ap\ba\ba+\pe\ba\ba+\ap\pe\ba.
\end{equation*}
Here we are using a picture of a piece of fruit to stand for taking a piece of that fruit. Thus \(\ap\) stands for taking an apple, \(\ap\pe\) for taking an apple and a pear, and \(\ap\ap\) for taking two apples.  You can think of the plus sign as standing for the ``exclusive or,'' that is, \(\ap+\ba\) would stand for ``I take an apple or a banana but not both.'' To say ``I take both an apple and a banana,'' we would write \(\ap\ba\). We can extend the analogy to mathematical notation by condensing our statement that we take three pieces of fruit to%
\begin{equation*}
\ap^3+\pe^3+\ba^3+\ap^2\pe+\ap^2\ba +\ap\pe^2+\pe^2\ba+
\ap\ba^2+\pe\ba^2 +\ap\pe\ba.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
In this notation \(\ap^3\) stands for taking a multiset of three apples, while \(\ap^2\ba\) stands for taking a multiset of two apples and a banana, and so on. What our notation is really doing is giving us a convenient way to list all three element multisets chosen from the set \(\{\ap,\pe,\ba\}\).\footnote{This approach was inspired by George Pólya's paper ``Picture Writing,'' in the December, 1956 issue of the \textsl{American Mathematical Monthly}, page 689. While we are taking a somewhat more formal approach than Pólya, it is still completely in the spirit of his work.\label{g:fn:idp403345025072}}%
\par
Suppose now that we plan to choose between one and three apples, between one and two pears, and between one and two bananas. In a somewhat clumsy way we could describe our fruit selections as%
\begin{align}
\ap\pe\ba\amp+\ap^2\pe\ba\amp+\cdots\amp+\ap^2\pe^2\ba
\amp+\cdots \amp+
\ap^2\pe^2\ba^2             \notag\\

\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403345036992}%
Substitute \(x\) for all of \(A\), \(P\) and \(B\) (or for the corresponding pictures) in the formula you got in \hyperref[x:activity:twopiecesoffruit]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:twopiecesoffruit}} and expand the result in powers of \(x\). Give an interpretation of the coefficient of \(x^n\).%

If we were to expand the formula%
\begin{equation}

we would get \hyperref[x:mrow:uptothreefruits]{Formula~(\ref{x:mrow:uptothreefruits})}. Thus \hyperref[x:mrow:uptothreefruits]{Formula~(\ref{x:mrow:uptothreefruits})} and \hyperref[x:men:threefruitsagain]{Formula~(\ref{x:men:threefruitsagain})} each describe the number of multisets we can choose from the set \(\{\ap,\pe,\ba\}\) in which \(\apple\)~appears between 1 and three times and \(\pear\) and \(\banana\)~each appear once or twice. We interpret \hyperref[x:mrow:uptothreefruits]{Formula~(\ref{x:mrow:uptothreefruits})} as describing each individual multiset we can choose, and we interpret \hyperref[x:men:threefruitsagain]{Formula~(\ref{x:men:threefruitsagain})} as saying that we first decide how many apples to take, and then decide how many pears to take, and then decide how many bananas to take. At this stage it might seem a bit magical that doing ordinary algebra with the second formula yields the first, but in fact we could define addition and multiplication with these pictures more formally so we could explain in detail why things work out. However since the pictures are for motivation, and are actually difficult to write out on paper, it doesn't make much sense to work out these details. We will see an explanation in another context later on.%

\begin{subsectionptx}{Picture functions}{}{Picture functions}{}{}{x:subsection:picturefunction}
As you've seen, in our descriptions of ways of choosing fruits, we've treated the pictures of the fruit as if they are variables. You've also likely noticed that it is much easier to do algebraic manipulations with letters rather than pictures, simply because it is time consuming to draw the same picture over and over again, while we are used to writing letters quickly. In the theory of generating functions, we associate variables or polynomials or even power series with members of a set. There is no standard language describing how we associate variables with members of a set, so we shall invent\footnote{We are really adapting language introduced by George Pólya.\label{g:fn:idp403345054176}} some. By a \terminology{picture} of a member of a set we will mean a variable, or perhaps a product of powers of variables (or even a sum of products of powers of variables). A function that assigns a picture \(P(s)\) to each member \(s\) of a set \(S\) will be called a \terminology{picture function} . The \terminology{picture enumerator}\index{picture enumerator} for a picture function \(P\) defined on a set \(S\) will be%
\begin{equation*}
E_P(S) = \sum_{s: s\in S}  P(s).
\end{equation*}
%
\par
We choose this language because the picture enumerator lists, or enumerates, all the elements of \(S\) according to their pictures. Thus \hyperref[x:mrow:uptothreefruits]{Formula~(\ref{x:mrow:uptothreefruits})} is the picture enumerator the set of all multisets of fruit with between one and three apples, one and two pears, and one and two bananas.%
\begin{exploration}{}{x:exploration:zerotothreeapples}%

\begin{exploration}{}{x:exploration:zerotothreefruits}%
How would you write down a picture enumerator that says we take between zero and three apples, between zero and three pears, and between zero and three bananas?%

Notice that when we used \(A^2\) to stand for taking two apples, and \(P^3\) to stand for taking three pears, then we used the product \(A^2P^3\) to stand for taking two apples and three pears. Thus we have chosen the picture of the ordered pair (2 apples, 3 pears) to be the product of the pictures of a multiset of two apples and a multiset of three pears.%

In \hyperref[x:exploration:reprovingbinomialtheorem]{Exercise~\ref{x:exploration:reprovingbinomialtheorem}} we see that we can think of the process of expanding the polynomial \((1+x)^n\) as a way of ``generating'' the binomial coefficients \(\binom{n}{k}\) as the coefficients of \(x^k\) in the expansion of \((1+x)^n\). For this reason, we say that \((1+x)^n\) is the ``generating function'' for the binomial coefficients \(\binom{n}{k}\). More generally, the \terminology{generating function} for a sequence \(a_i\), defined for \(i\) with \(0\le i\le n\) is the expression \(\sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \cdots + a_nx^n\), and the \terminology{generating function}\index{generating function} for the sequence \(a_i\) with \(i\ge 0\) is the expression \(\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_ix^i\).%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403345133952}%
The generating function for the sequence \(1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots\) is%
\begin{equation*}
1 + 2x + 4x^2 + 8x^3 + \cdots
\end{equation*}
which we will see later can be expressed as%
\begin{equation*}
1+(2x) + (2x)^2 + (2x)^3 + \cdots = \frac{1}{1-2x}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
The sequence \(1, 3, 5, 7,\ldots\) has generating function%
\begin{equation*}
1+3x + 5x^2 +7x^3 + \cdots = \frac{1+x}{(1-x)^2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We will soon see why you can write the infinite series in this nice way.%
\end{example}
Generating functions for infinite sequences are examples of power series. In calculus it is important to think about whether a power series converges in order to determine whether or not it represents a function. In a nice twist of language, even though we use the phrase generating function as the name of a power series in combinatorics, we don't require the power series to actually represent a function in the usual sense, and so we don't have to worry about convergence.\footnote{In the evolution of our current mathematical terminology, the word function evolved through several meanings, starting with very imprecise meanings and ending with our current rather precise meaning.  The terminology ``generating function'' may be thought of as an example of one of the earlier usages of the term function.\label{g:fn:idp403345138960}} Instead we think of a power series as a convenient way of representing the terms of a sequence of numbers of interest to us. The only justification for saying that such a representation is convenient is because of the way algebraic properties of power series capture some of the important properties of some sequences that are of combinatorial importance. The remainder of this chapter is devoted to giving examples of how the algebra of power series reflects combinatorial ideas.%
\par
Because we choose to think of power series as strings of symbols that we manipulate by using the ordinary rules of algebra and we choose to ignore issues of convergence, we have to avoid manipulating power series in a way that would require us to add infinitely many real numbers. For example, we cannot make the substitution of \(y+1\) for \(x\) in the power series \(\sum_{i=0}^\infty x^i\), because in order to interpret \(\sum_{i=0}^\infty (y+1)^i\) as a power series we would have to apply the binomial theorem to each of the \((y+1)^i\) terms, and then collect like terms, giving us infinitely many ones added together as the coefficient of \(y^0\), and in fact infinitely many numbers added together for the coefficient of any~\(y^i\). (On the other hand, it would be fine to substitute \(y+y^2\) for \(x\). Can you see why?)%

\begin{subsectionptx}{The extended binomial theorem and multisets}{}{The extended binomial theorem and multisets}{}{}{g:subsection:idp403345198720}
The binomial theorem tells us how to expand the binomial \((1+x)^n\):%
\begin{equation*}
(1+x)^n = \binom{n}{0} + \binom{n}{1}x + \binom{n}{2}x^2 + \cdots + \binom{n}{n}x^n\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This works for any positive integer \(n\).%
\par
We will now consider the \emph{extended} binomial theorem, which tells us what to do if \(n\) is a negative integer.  In particular, we will see how to expand \((1+x)^{-n} = \frac{1}{(1+x)^n}\) (here taking \(n\) positive again).%
\par
Although we could use calculus-like tricks to manipulate series directly (and we will demonstrate this in a bit), let's first try to develop the formula combinatorially using generating functions.  After all, \((1+x)^n\) is the generating function for the number \(k\)-element subsets of \([n]\) (you should be able to say why for two good reasons now).%
\par
What happens when we instead count the number of \(k\)-element \emph{multisets} of \([n]\)?  Remember, we saw in \hyperref[x:theorem:thm-multisetsize]{Theorem~\ref{x:theorem:thm-multisetsize}} that this can be expressed as the binomial coefficeint \(\mchoose{n}{k} = \binom{n+k-1}{k}\).  Let's put this into a generating function.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403345215648}%

\item{}Express the generating function in which the coefficient of \(x^k\) is the number of \(k\)-element multisets chosen from \([n]\) as a \emph{power} of a power series.%

Note, it is useful to interpret the coefficient 1 as the number of multisets of size \(k\) chosen from the \emph{singleton} set \(\{i\}\). Namely, there is only one way to choose a multiset of size \(k\) from \(\{i\}\): choose \(i\) exactly \(k\) times.%
\par

\end{activity}
Another way to arrive at the conclusion of the previous activity is the following.  Set \(S = 1 + x + x^2 + \cdots\).  Then \(xS = x + x^2 + x^3 + \cdots\).  Consider the difference \(S - xS\).  Combining like terms we find \(S-xS = (1-x)S = 1\), as every power of \(x\) cancels except the first.  Therefore we find%

\typeout{************************************************}
%
\begin{subsectionptx}{Generating Functions and Recurrence Relations}{}{Generating Functions and Recurrence Relations}{}{}{g:subsection:idp403345297856}
Recall that a recurrence relation for a sequence \(a_n\) expresses \(a_n\) in terms of values \(a_i\) for \(i\lt n\). For example, the equation \(a_i=3a_{i-1} +2^i\) is a first order linear constant coefficient recurrence.%
\par
Algebraic manipulations with generating functions can sometimes reveal the solutions to a recurrence relation.%
\begin{example}{}{x:example:eg_genfun-recursion}%
Find a generating functions for the recurrence relation \(a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 4a_{n-2}\) with initial conditions \(a_1 = 3\) and \(a_2 = 13\) (this is the same recurrence relation we solved using the characteristic root technique in \hyperref[x:example:eg_char-roots]{Example~\ref{x:example:eg_char-roots}}).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403345305232}{}\quad{}In general, we have some generating function \(f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \cdots\).  In this case, we know that \(a_1 = 3\) and \(a_2 = 13\); we can find \(a_3 = 51\) and, by working backwards, \(a_0 = 1\).  Having these values makes writing the following out a little clearer.%
\par
In addition to \(f(x)\) we will also consider \(3x\cdot f(x)\) and \(4x^2 f(x)\).%
\begin{align*}
f(x) = \amp 1 + 3x + 13x^2 + 51 x^3 + \cdots \\
3x f(x) = \amp 3x + 9x^2 + 39x^3 + 153 x^4 +  \\
4x^2 f(x) = \amp 4x^2 + 12x^3 + 52x^4 + 204 x^5 +  
\end{align*}
Now subtract: \(f(x) - 3xf(x) - 4x^2f(x) = 1\).  That's it.  Everything else on the right and side cancels.  Why?  Well, if you consider the \(x^n\) term, it will be \(a_n x^n - 3a_{n-1}x^n - 4a_{n-2}x^n\).  The recurrence relation tells us that the coefficient will be zero!%
\par
Simplifying this a bit more, we find \([1- 3x - 4x^2]f(x) = 1\), or that the generating function for the sequence is%
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = \frac{1}{1-3x-4x^2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Now the question becomes, why does this help?  We would like to find a closed formula for \(a_n\).  Right now, we just know that \(a_n\) is the coefficient of \(x^n\) in the power series for \(\frac{1}{1-3x-4x^2}\).  We will come back to this in the next subsection.%

Find the generating function for the solutions to the recurrence%
\begin{equation*}
a_i=5a_{i-1}-6a_{i-2}\text{.}

\end{exploration}
Of course there is no need to use generating functions to solve recurrences like the ones above, since we could use the characteristic root technique.  It gets more interesting when we consider recurrence relations for which the characteristic root technique fails.%
\begin{activity}{}{x:activity:substituteandsolve}%

\item{}Write out the first few terms of the sequence.  Then write down the generating series \(f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \cdots\) (that is, just substitute in the right values for \(a_i\)). %
\item{}Write out the series for \(3x f(x)\).  Does it make sense why \(3x\) is the right thing to multiply by?%
\item{}Now subtract \(f(x) - 3xf(x)\) to get a series for \((1-3x)\cdot f(x)\).  Show how this proves that the generating function for \((a_n)\) is%

The sequence of problems that follows (culminating in \hyperref[x:exploration:solveFibonacci]{Exercise~\ref{x:exploration:solveFibonacci}}) describes a number of hypotheses we might make about a fictional population of rabbits. We use the example of a rabbit population for historic reasons; our goal is a classical sequence of numbers called Fibonacci numbers. When Fibonacci\footnote{Apparently Leanardo de Pisa was given the name Fibonacci posthumously. It is a shortening of ``son of Bonacci'' in Italian.\label{g:fn:idp403345356256}} introduced them, he did so with a fictional population of rabbits.\index{Fibonacci numbers}%

Suppose we start (at the end of month 0) with 10 pairs of baby rabbits, and that after baby rabbits mature for one month they begin to reproduce, with each pair producing two new pairs at the end of each month afterwards. Suppose further that over the time we observe the rabbits, none die.%
\par
Let \(a_n\) be the number of rabbits we have at the end of month \(n\). So we have \(a_0 = 10\), \(a_1 = 10\), \(a_2 = 30\), and so on.  Show that \(a_n=a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2}\). This is an example of a \terminology{second order}\index{recurrence!second order}\index{second order recurrence} \emph{linear}\index{recurrence!linear}\index{linear recurrence!second order} recurrence with constant coefficients.\index{recurrence!constant coefficient}%

Using a method similar to that of \hyperref[x:activity:substituteandsolve]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:substituteandsolve}}, show that%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_ix^i = \frac{10}{1-x-2x^2}.
\end{equation*}
This gives us the generating function for the sequence \(a_i\) giving the population in month \(i\); shortly we shall see a method for converting this to a solution to the recurrence.%

In Fibonacci's original problem, each pair of mature rabbits produces one new pair at the end of each month, but otherwise the situation is the same as in \hyperref[x:exploration:secondorderintroduction]{Exercise~\ref{x:exploration:secondorderintroduction}}.

Use long division on \(\dfrac{x}{1-x-x^2}\) and see what pops out.%
\end{exploration}
In the next section we will see how to use the generating functions for these recursions to find closed formulas for the sequence, including a closed formula for the Fibonacci numbers.  While we are here though, consider the following example of another reason why having a generating function for the Fibonacci numbers is useful.%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403345385072}%
Use generating functions to prove the identity \(F_{n+1} = \binom{n}{0} + \binom{n-1}{1} + \binom{n-2}{2} + \cdots \) (note this is a finite sum).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403345386688}{}\quad{}Start with the generating function for the sequence \(1, 1, 2, 3, 5\), which we saw in \hyperref[x:exploration:originalFibonacci]{Exercise~\ref{x:exploration:originalFibonacci}} is%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{1-x-x^2} = 1 + x + 2x^2 + \cdots + F_{n+1}x^n+ \cdots\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Of course we also have%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{1-x} = 1 + x + x^2 + \cdots
\end{equation*}
and this is almost the same thing.  In fact, if we replace \(x\) with \(x+x^2\) we get the Fibonacci generating function:%
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{1-(x+x^2)} = \amp 1 + (x+x^2) + (x+x^2)^2 + \cdots \\
= \amp 1 + x(1+x) + x^2(1+x)^2 + x^3(1+x)^3 + \cdots\text{.}
\end{align*}
Now use the binomial theorem on each of the \((1+x)^n\) terms and distribute:%
\begin{align*}
1 + x + x^2 + (x^2 +\amp 2x^3 + x^4)\\
+ (\amp x^3 + 3x^4 + 3x^5 + x^6)\\
\amp + (x^4 + 4x^5 + 6x^6 + 4x^7 + x^8) + \cdots \text{.}
\end{align*}
Look at the coefficient of \(x^4\), for example.  We have \(F_5 = 1 + 3 + 1 = \binom{4}{0} + \binom{3}{1} + \binom{2}{2}\).  It should be clear that this works in general: the coefficient of \(x^n\) will be \(F_{n+1}\) on the one hand, and \(\binom{n}{0} + \binom{n-1}{1} + \binom{n-2}{2}+ \cdots\) on the other.%
\end{example}
We also point out that there are other techniques for getting the generating function for a sequence other than the ``differencing'' we have used above.  We illustrate this with an extreme example.%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403345396672}%
Find the generating function for the sequence \((a_n)\) where \(a_n = \binom{2n}{n}\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403345398672}{}\quad{}We have seen that the power series \(1 + x + x^2 + \cdots \) can be written as \(\frac{1}{1-x}\).  Here we wish to find a nice expression for%
\begin{equation*}
\binom{1}{0} + \binom{2}{1}x + \binom{4}{2}x^2 + \binom{6}{3}x^3+ \cdots\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
First we note a sort of recurrence: \((n+1)a_{n+1} = (4n+2)a_n\).  To verify this use the factorial formula for \(\binom{n}{k}\):%
\begin{equation*}
(n+1)a_{n+1} = (n+1)\binom{2n+2}{n+1} = (n+1)\frac{(2n+2)(2n+1)}{(n+1)!(n+1)!}(2n)! = (4n+2)\binom{2n}{n} \text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Now, \(f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n\) has derivative%
\begin{equation*}
f'(x) = a_1 + 2a_2x + 3a_3x^2 + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+1)a_{n+1}x^n
\end{equation*}
and further%
\begin{equation*}
xf'(x) = a_1x + 2a_2x^2 + 3a_3x^3 + \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^\infty na_nx^n\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Using the recurrence above, we have%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+1)a_{n+1}x^n = 4\sum_{n=0}^\infty na_nx^n + 2\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_nx^n\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This means%
\begin{equation*}
f'(x) = 4xf'(x) + 2f(x)
\end{equation*}
or equivalently%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)} = \frac{2}{1-4x}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Now integrate!  We get%
\begin{equation*}
\ln f(x) = -\frac{1}{2}\ln(1-4x) + c\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Since \(a_0 =1\), it must be \(c = 0\).  Finally then, by exponentiating, we arrive at%
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-4x}}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{example}

The generating functions you found in the previous section all can be expressed in terms of the reciprocal of a quadratic polynomial. However without a power series representation, the generating function doesn't tell us what the sequence is. It turns out that whenever you can factor a polynomial into linear factors (and over the complex numbers such a factorization always exists) you can use that factorization to express the reciprocal in terms of power series.%
\begin{activity}{}{x:activity:simplifysumoffractions}%
Express \(\frac{1}{x-3} + \frac{2}{x-2}\) as a single fraction.%
\end{activity}
\begin{activity}{}{x:activity:partialfractionsintro}%
In \hyperref[x:activity:simplifysumoffractions]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:simplifysumoffractions}} you see that when we added numerical multiples of the reciprocals of first degree polynomials we got a fraction in which the denominator is a quadratic polynomial. This will always happen unless the two denominators are multiples of each other, because their least common multiple will simply be their product, a quadratic polynomial. This leads us to ask whether a fraction whose denominator is a quadratic polynomial can always be expressed as a sum of fractions whose denominators are first degree polynomials. Find numbers \(c\) and \(d\) so that%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{5x+1}{(x-3)(x+5)} = \frac{c}{x-3} + \frac{d}{x+5}.
\end{equation*}
%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403345417984-back}{[Hint]}}\end{activity}
\begin{activity}{}{x:activity:partialfractions1}%
In \hyperref[x:activity:partialfractionsintro]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:partialfractionsintro}} you may have simply guessed at values of \(c\) and \(d\), or you may have solved a system of equations in the two unknowns \(c\) and \(d\). Given constants \(a\), \(b\), \(r_1\), and \(r_2\) (with \(r_1\not= r_2\)), write down a system of equations we can solve for \(c\) and \(d\) to write%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{ax+b}{(x-r_1)(x-r_2)} = \frac{c}{x-r_1} + \frac{d}{x-r_2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%

Writing down the equations in \hyperref[x:activity:partialfractions1]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:partialfractions1}} and solving them is called the \terminology{method of partial fractions}.\index{partial fractions!method of} This method will let you find power series expansions for generating functions of the type you found in \hyperref[x:exploration:secondorderintroduction]{Problems~\ref{x:exploration:secondorderintroduction}} to \hyperref[x:exploration:secondordernonhomo]{Exercise~\ref{x:exploration:secondordernonhomo}}. However you have to be able to factor the quadratic polynomials that are in the denominators of your generating functions.%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403345442128}%
Let's return to our familiar recurrence relation \(a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 4a_{n-2}\) with initial terms \(a_1 = 3\) and \(a_2 = 13\).%
\par
In \hyperref[x:example:eg_char-roots]{Example~\ref{x:example:eg_char-roots}} we used the characteristic root technique to find the closed formula%
\begin{equation*}
a_n = \frac{4}{5} 4^n + \frac{1}{5} (-1)^n \text{.}
\end{equation*}
In \hyperref[x:example:eg_genfun-recursion]{Example~\ref{x:example:eg_genfun-recursion}} we found that the generating function for the sequence was%
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = \frac{1}{1-3x - 4x^2}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
We can use partial fractions to reconcile these two results.%
\par
Note that the denominator factors as \((1+x)(1-4x)\).  We write%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1}{1-3x-4x^2} = \frac{c}{1+x}+\frac{d}{1-4x}
\end{equation*}
and solve for \(c\) and \(d\).  This is done by finding a common denominator and equating the numerators to get%
\begin{equation*}
1 = c(1-4x) + d(1+x)
\end{equation*}
Note that if \(x = -1\) this gives use \(1 = 5c\) so \(c = \frac{1}{5}\).  Similarly, if \(x = \frac{1}{4}\) we find \(1 = \frac{5}{4}d\) so \(d = \frac{4}{5}\).  (These constants should look familiar.)%
\par
So what?  The generating function for \(a_n\) can now be expressed as the sum of two generating functions: \(\frac{1/5}{1+x}\) and \(\frac{4/5}{1-4x}\).  What's more, these generating functions have nice power series:%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{1/5}{1+x} = \frac{1}{5}\left( 1-x+x^2-x^3+\cdots +(-1)^nx^n+\cdots\right)\text{;}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{4/5}{(1-4x)} = \frac{4}{5} \left(1+4x + 16x^2 + \cdots + 4^nx^n+ \cdots \right)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Both of these were found by substituting a value (either \(-x\) or \(4x\)) into the power series for \(\frac{1}{1-x}\).%
\par
Since \(a_n\) is the coefficient of \(x^n\), we get%
\begin{equation*}
a_n = \frac{1}{5}(-1)^n + \frac{4}{5}4^n
\end{equation*}
as expected.%

\begin{sectionptx}{Partitions of Sets}{}{Partitions of Sets}{}{}{x:section:sec_adv-stirling}
\begin{introduction}{}%
Partitions are one of the core ideas in discrete mathematics.  Recall that a \terminology{partition} of a set \(S\) is a collection of mutually disjoint subsets of \(S\) whose union is all of \(S\).  In other words, every element of \(S\) belongs to exactly one of the subsets of the partition.  We call the subsets that make up the partition \terminology{blocks} or \terminology{parts} of the partition.%
\par
The integers can be naturally partitioned into evens and odds.  In fact, this is just a specific case of partitioning the integers by their reminder when divided by a fixed constant; another example is that every integer has remainder 0, 1, or 2 when divided by 3.%
\par
Finite sets also have natural partitions: the set of all 4-bit strings can be partitioned according to weight:%
\begin{equation*}
\B^4_0 \cup \B^4_1 \cup B^4_2 \cup \B^4_3 \cup \B^4_4 = \B^4\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Using the sum principle on these disjoint sets leads directly to the identity \(\binom{4}{0} + \binom{4}{1} + \binom{4}{2} + \binom{4}{3} + \binom{4}{4} = 2^4\) (and of course the 4 can be replaced with any \(n\) here).%
\par
In fact, many of the identities we established in \hyperref[x:section:sec_basic-proofs]{Section~\ref{x:section:sec_basic-proofs}} using a combinatorial proof work precisely because we can count a set of outcomes all at once and also by counting the size of each block in a particular partition.  For example, in \hyperref[x:exploration:act_derangement-binom]{Exercise~\ref{x:exploration:act_derangement-binom}} we proved that%
\begin{equation*}
\binom{n}{0} d_{0} + \binom{n}{1} d_{1} + \binom{n}{2} d_{2} + \ldots + \binom{n}{n} d_{n} = n!
\end{equation*}
by partitioning the \(n!\) permutations of \([n]\) into blocks according to how many are fixed in position while the rest are deranged.%
\par
Even the formula for binomial coefficients, \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}\), comes from partitioning the \(k\)-permutations of \([n]\) into blocks according to which subset of \([n]\) is selected (and then \(\binom{n}{k}\) is precisely the number of blocks).%
\par
In this section we will abstract this fundamental idea of partitions by one level.  Instead of using particular partitions to answer counting questions, we will ask counting questions about partitions themselves.  As we will see, this helps us solve yet more counting questions.%
\par
In \hyperref[x:section:sec_basic-quotient]{Section~\ref{x:section:sec_basic-quotient}} we considered some ways to distribute items to recipients.  Most basic counting formulas can be thought of as counting the number of ways to distribute either distinct or identical items to distinct recipients.  For example, distributing \(k\) distinct items to \(n\) distinct recipients can be done in \(n^k\) ways, if recipients can receive any number of items, or \(P(n,k)\) ways if recipients can receive at most one item.  If the items are identical, the corresponding number of ways to distribute them are \(\mchoose{n}{k}\) and \(\binom{n}{k}\).%
\par
What if the recipients are not distinct?  Say we wish to distribute \(k\) books (either distinct or identical) to \(n\) identical boxes.  This is a perfectly natural extension, but we will see the answer is not.  First, let's get a feel for what this might look like for some small values of \(k\) and \(n\).%
\begin{activity}{}{x:activity:act_stirlingintro}%
Suppose you have \(3\) distinct books you want to put into \(5\) identical boxes.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}How many ways can you do this if each box can have at most one book?%
\item{}How many ways can you do this if any box can have any number of books?  You might want to consider three cases: one, two, or three boxes are used.  Assume we do not care about the order in which the books are placed inside boxes.%
\item{}Describe the outcomes we are counting in abstract mathematical terms.  What sort of mathematical objects are we counting?%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
\begin{activity}{}{x:activity:act_intpartintro}%
Suppose you have \(3\) identical books you want to put in \(5\) identical boxes.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}How many ways can you do this if each box can have at most one book?%
\item{}How many ways can you do this if any box can have any number of books?  Again, you should consider three cases.%
\item{}What mathematical objects are we counting here?%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
Both of the previous two activities can be solved by counting partitions.  The difference comes down to whether we partition a set of distinct objects or identical objects.  It is not immediately clear how to model partitioning identical objects, and we will put this off until \hyperref[x:section:sec_adv-linearparts]{Section~\ref{x:section:sec_adv-linearparts}}.  Partitioning \emph{distinct} objects simply means finding a partition of a set, the topic of the current section.%

\begin{subsectionptx}{Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind}{}{Stirling Numbers of the Second Kind}{}{}{g:subsection:idp403345646704}
We would like to count the number of ways to partition a set.%
\begin{definition}{}{x:definition:def-stirling}%
Denote by \(S(k,n)\) the number of partitions of \([k]\) into exactly \(n\) subsets.  We call \(S(k,n)\) a \terminology{Stirling number (of the second kind)}.%
\end{definition}
Note that we write \(S(k,n)\) instead of \(S(n,k)\) here because we try to use \(k\) for the number of elements being distributed and \(n\) for the number of recipients.  When other books use \(S(n,k)\), they mean the number of partitions of \([n]\) into exactly \(k\) blocks.  This is the same definition as we give, but with our renamed variables the formulas we get might look different.%
\par
For example, consider how to partition \([3]\) into exactly two sets:%
\begin{equation*}
\{1,2\}, \{3\} \qquad \qquad \{1,3\},\{2\} \qquad \qquad \{2,3\},\{1\}
\end{equation*}
and that is all, so \(S(3,2) = 3\).  We do not care about the order the elements appear in each block, nor the order in which the blocks appear.  Thus we see the Stirling numbers count the number of ways to distribute \(k\) distinct items to \(n\) identical recipients so that each recipient gets at least one item.%

We can arrange the Stirling numbers into a triangle (called \terminology{Stirling's second triangle}).  The first five rows are shown below.  The entries are indexed differently than in Pascal's triangle: the top 1 represents \(S(1,1)\), so for example, \(S(5,2) = 15\).%

\par
How were these found?  Sure, we could have written out all 25 of the partitions of \([5]\) into exactly \(3\) blocks, but we didn't.  Could there be some way to get 25 from the entries above it?  That is, what is the recurrence relation among the Stirling numbers?%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403345692464}%
Write down (if you haven't already) all 6 partitions of \([4]\) into \(3\) blocks.  Break these into two cases by where 4 is: is 4 in solitary confinement (in a singleton set) or does he have a cellmate?%
\end{activity}
Now that you have some experience with listing the \(S(4,3)\) partitions of \([4]\), the next example will help us to generalize.%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403345697584}%
Let's see how to take \(S(4,2) = 7\) and \(S(4,3) = 6\) to compute \(S(5,3) = 25\).%
\par
First, here are the partitions of \([4]\) into 2 blocks (group A) or 3 blocks (group B), side by side:%
\begin{sidebyside}{2}{0.05}{0.05}{0.1}%
\begin{sbspanel}{0.5}%
Group A:%
\begin{align*}
\{1\}, ~ \{2,3,4\}\qquad \amp \{1,2\}, ~ \{3, 4\}\\
\{2\}, ~ \{1,3,4\}\qquad \amp \{1,3\}, ~ \{2, 4\}\\
\{3\}, ~ \{1,2,4\} \qquad \amp \{2,3\}, ~ \{1, 4\}\\
\{4\}, ~ \{1,2,3\} \qquad\amp 
\end{align*}
%
\end{sbspanel}%
\begin{sbspanel}{0.3}%
\par
Group B:%
\begin{gather*}
\{3\}, ~ \{1,2\}, ~ \{4\}\\
\{2\}, ~ \{1,3\}, ~ \{4\}\\
\{2\}, ~ \{1,4\}, ~ \{3\}\\
\{1\}, ~ \{2,3\}, ~ \{4\}\\
\{1\}, ~ \{2,4\}, ~ \{3\}\\
\{1\}, ~ \{3,4\}, ~ \{2\}
\end{gather*}
%
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
(Notice the \(\binom{4}{2}\) ways of listing the middle column in group B.)%
\par
Now, to list the \(S(5,3)\) partitions of \([5]\) into \(3\) parts, we need to add 5 somewhere.  We can either%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.]
\item{}Let 5 be a singleton block, along with any of the partitions from group A; or%
\item{}Let 5 join any of the blocks in any of the partitions of group B.%
\end{enumerate}
The second option can be accomplished in \(3\cdot 6\) ways.  Thus \(S(5,3) = 7 + 3\cdot 6\).%
\end{example}
\begin{activity}{}{x:activity:secondstirlingrecurrence}%
Now generalize.  In a partition of the set \([k]\), the number \(k\) is either in a block by itself, or it is not.  Find a two variable recurrence for \(S(k,n)\), valid for \(k\) and \(n\) larger than one.%

We have often thought of counting problems as asking about how many functions there are from a \(k\)-elements set to an \(n\)-element set.  The answer to this question is \(n^k\) for all functions and \(P(n,k)\) for injective functions.  What about surjective functions?  There is a reason we haven't asked this question yet, but now we can at least get an expression for the number of surjections in terms of Stirling numbers.%
\begin{exploration}{}{g:exploration:idp403345758544}%
Given a function \(f\) from a \(k\)-element set \(K\) to an \(n\)-element set, we can define a partition of \(K\) by putting \(x\) and \(y\) in the same block of the partition if and only if \(f(x)=f(y)\). How many blocks does the partition have if \(f\) is surjective? How is the number of functions from a \(k\)-element set \emph{onto} an \(n\)-element set related to a Stirling number?

\begin{exploration}{}{x:exploration:Stirlingfalling}%

Here is a brief summary of what we have already discovered.%
\par
Directly from the definition, we see that \(S(k,1) = 1\) and \(S(k,k) = 1\).  From these we can compute the remaining Stirling numbers using the recursion%
\begin{equation*}
S(k,n) = nS(k-1,n) + S(k-1, n-1).
\end{equation*}
This recursion is justified by dividing the partitions of \([k]\) into those which contain \(k\) as a singleton set (there are \(S(k-1, n-1)\) of these) and those that don't (there are \(n\) choices for where \(k\) could be for each of the \(S(k-1, n)\) partitions of \([k-1]\) into \(n\) blocks).%
\par
From this, we generated Stirling's second triangle.%

\end{exploration}
Let's consider some ways to compute Stirling numbers directly.%
\par
While we might not have a nice closed formula for all Stirling numbers in terms of \(k\) and \(n\), we can give closed formulas for those Stirling numbers close to the edges of the triangle.  We have already considered some of these in \hyperref[x:activity:act_stirlingcomputations]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:act_stirlingcomputations}}.

The proof of the formula above suggests that looking at the sizes of the blocks might be helpful.  Let's see what this might look like with an example.%

\index{partition of a set!type vector}\index{type vector of a partition of a set} Whenever we want to partition \(k\) items in \(n\) blocks, we can consider cases.

It is in this form that James Stirling originally developed these numbers. \(S(k,n)\) is used to convert from powers to binomial  coefficients as shown in the following:%
\begin{theorem}{}{}{x:theorem:thm-stirling-polynomial2}%
\(x^{k} = S\left(k,1 \right)\binom{x}{1}1! + S\left(k,2 \right) \binom{x}{2}2! + \ldots + S\left(k,k \right)\binom{x}{k} k!\)%

Prove \hyperref[x:theorem:thm-stirling-polynomial2]{Theorem~\ref{x:theorem:thm-stirling-polynomial2}}%
\end{exploration}
As an example of the previous two theorems, consider how to write \(x^3\).%
\par
Using \hyperref[x:theorem:thm-stirling-polynomial]{Theorem~\ref{x:theorem:thm-stirling-polynomial}}, we can write%
\begin{equation*}
x^3 = S(3,1)x + S(3,2)x(x-1) + S(3,3)x(x-1)(x-2) = x + 3x(x-1) + x(x-1)(x-2)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Recognizing that the factors that involve \(x\) look like a factorial, we can convert them into binomial coefficients, which is what \hyperref[x:theorem:thm-stirling-polynomial2]{Theorem~\ref{x:theorem:thm-stirling-polynomial2}} says:%
\begin{equation*}
x^3 = \binom{x}{1} + 3\binom{x}{2}2! + \binom{x}{3}3! = \binom{x}{1} + 6\binom{x}{2} + 6 \binom{x}{3}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Less we think this is nothing more than an interesting factoid, we can use it to establish the following.%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403346016080}%
Prove that \(1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \cdots + n^3 = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2\).  In other words, the square of any triangular number is the sum of cubes!%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403346017696}{}\quad{}We recognize that each cube on the left-hand side can be expressed as \(\binom{x}{1} + 6 \binom{x}{2} + 6\binom{x}{3}\).  Thus%
\begin{align*}
1^3 + 2^3 + \cdots + n^3 = \amp \sum_{x=1}^n \left(\binom{x}{1} + 6 \binom{x}{2} + 6\binom{x}{3}\right)\\
= \amp \sum_{x=1}^n \binom{x}{1} + 6 \sum_{x=1}^n \binom{x}{2} + 6 \sum_{x=1}^n \binom{x}{3}\text{.}
\end{align*}
Now each of the three sums of binomial coefficients can be simplified using the Hockey Stick Theorem, to get%
\begin{align*}
=  \amp \binom{n+1}{2} + 6 \binom{n+1}{3} + 6 \binom{n+1}{4} \\
= \amp \binom{n+1}{2} + 6\left(\binom{n+1}{3}+\binom{n+1}{4}\right) \\
= \amp \binom{n+1}{2} + 6\binom{n+2}{4} 
\end{align*}
where the last step uses the Pascal triangle recurrence.%
\par
Finally, write these last two binomial coefficients using the factorial formula and simplify:%
\begin{equation*}
\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + \frac{(n+2)(n+1)n(n-1)}{4} = \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}

\begin{subsectionptx}{Bell Numbers}{}{Bell Numbers}{}{}{x:subsection:subsec_bell}
The Bell number, \(B_{k}\), denotes the number of ways that a set of \(k\) objects can be partitioned into nonempty subsets. We have already seen how to partition a set of \(k\) objects into exactly \(n\) subsets: \(S(k,n)\).  So then \(B_k = \sum_{n=1}^kS(k,n)\).  We take \(B_0 = 1\).%
\par
The sequence of Bell numbers starts%
\begin{equation*}
1, 1, 2, 5, 15, 52, 203, 877, 4140, 21147, 115975, \ldots
\end{equation*}
Notice that the first four numbers look like Catalan numbers.  In fact, one of the many things the Catalan numbers count are \emph{non-crossing} set partitions.\footnote{A set partition is said to be \terminology{non-crossing} as long as whenever \(a,b\) belong to one block and \(c,d\) belong to another, we have that \(a\) and \(b\) are both either larger or smaller than both of \(c\) and \(d\).\label{g:fn:idp403346045888}}  So if \(C_n\) counts only some of the set partitions, then it must be that \(C_n \le B_n\) for all \(n\).%
\par
The Bell numbers can be generated by constructing what is called the Bell Triangle. To construct this triangle, begin with a 1 at the top and a 1 below it. Add these two numbers together and put the sum 2, to the right of the 1 in the second column. This 2 is also the first entry of the third row. The second entry in the third row is found by adding the 2 to the number 1 above it. This sum is 3 and goes to the right of the 2. The 3 is now below a 2. Adding these two numbers produces the last number, 5, in the third row. Since 5 has no number above it, the third row is complete. 5 now becomes the first number in the fourth row and the process continues.%

To summarize, construction of the triangle follows two basic rules:%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}The last number of each row is the first number of the next row.%
\item{}All other numbers are found by adding the number to the left of the missing number to the number directly above this same number.%
\end{enumerate}
When the triangle is extended, as above, the Bell Numbers are found down the first column as well as along the outside diagonal.%
\begin{exploration}{}{g:exploration:idp403346076848}%
Why does this triangle construction give you the Bell numbers?  Explain in terms of set partitions.%
\end{exploration}
As with Pascal's Triangle, the Bell triangle has several interesting properties.%
\begin{exploration}{}{g:exploration:idp403346078624}%
If the sum of a row is added to the Bell number at the end of that row, the next Bell number is obtained. For example, the sum of the fourth row plus the Bell number at the end of the row: \(15 + 20 + 27 + 37 + 52 + 52\) is 203, the next Bell number.  Why does this happen?%
\end{exploration}
\begin{exploration}{}{g:exploration:idp403346080512}%
Another pattern you might notice: the numbers of the second diagonal \(1, 3, 10, 37, 151, 674, \ldots\) are the sums of the horizontal rows.  Prove this!%
\end{exploration}
Rotating the triangle slightly creates a \emph{difference} triangle analogous to Pascal's Triangle. The entries that are formed recursively by adding in Pascal's Triangle are now differences of the two numbers above them in the Bell triangle.%

\begin{exploration}{}{g:exploration:idp403346119936}%

This pattern suggests the \({(n + 1)}^{\text{th}}\) Bell Number can be represented recursively by \(B_{n + 1} = \binom{n}{0} B_{0} + \binom{n}{1} B_{1} + \binom{n}{2}B_{2} + \ldots + \binom{n}{n} B_{n}\). The coefficients of this equation are the entries of the \(n\)th row of Pascal's triangle.%
\begin{exploration}{}{x:exploration:act_bellrecurrence}%
Prove the recurrence%
\begin{equation*}
B_{k + 1} = \binom{k}{0} B_{0} + \binom{k}{1} B_{1} + \binom{k}{2}B_{2} + \ldots + \binom{k}{k} B_{k}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{exploration}
The Bell numbers are related to the Stirling numbers and can be defined as the sum of the Stirling numbers of the second kind. That is, \(B_{k} = S(k,1) + S(k,2) + \cdots + S(k,k)\), where \(S(k,n)\) represents the number of ways of grouping \(k\) elements into \(n\) subsets. So \(B_{3} = S(3,1) + S(3,2) + S(3,3) = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5\). Since the Bell numbers count the partitions of a set of elements, they are used in prime-number theory to enumerate the number of ways to factor a number with distinct prime factors. For example, 42 has three distinct prime factors: 2, 3, and 7. Since \(B_{3} = 5\) , we know there are five ways of factoring 42. These are \(2 \times 3 \times 7\), \(2 \times 21\), \(3 \times 14\), \(6 \times 7\), and \(42\). So the number \(210\), which has 4 distinct factors, 2, 3, 5, and 7, can be factored in \(B_{4} = 15\) ways.%
\par
The Bell numbers can be used to model many real-life situations. For example, the number of different ways two people can sleep in unlabeled twin beds is \(B_{2} = 2\) ways: They can sleep in the same bed or in separate beds. The number of ways of serving a dinner consisting of three items, such as a salad, bread, and fish is \(B_{3} = 5\) ways: each could be served on a separate plate, salad and bread could be on one plate and fish on another, salad and fish on one plate and bread on another, or all three items could be on the same plate. This example serves as a model for the five ways three people can occupy three unlabeled beds, the five ways three prisoners can be handcuffed together, the five ways three nations can be form alliances, or any situation of partitioning three distinct elements into non-empty subsets.%
\par
One interesting application of Bell numbers is in counting the number of rhyme schemes possible for a stanza in poetry. There are \(B_{2} = 2\) possibilities for a two-line stanza: the lines can either rhyme or not rhyme. The possible rhyme schemes of a three-line stanza can be described as aaa, aab, aba, abb, and abc: thus there are 5 or \(B_{3}\) possible rhyme schemes. The Japanese used diagrams depicting possible rhyme schemes of a five-line stanza \(B_{5} = 52\) as early as 1000 A.D. in the \emph{Tale of the Genji} by Lady Shikibu Murasaki.%
\begin{exploration}{}{g:exploration:idp403346165472}%
List all 15 rhyme schemes for a four-line stanza.  Identify the \(C_4 = 14\) such schemes that are ``planar'' (and say what this means).%

List all 15 set partitions of \([4]\).  Identify the \(C_4 = 14\) such partitions that are ``non-crossing'' (and say what this means).%

We conclude with an interesting exercise.%

Let \(P(x) = c_{0}u_{0} + c_{1}u_{1} + c_{2}u_{2} + \cdots\) be any element of \(V\), and define the functional \(L\) as follows: \(L\lbrack P(x)\rbrack = c_{0} + c_{1} + \cdots\).%

A multiset of positive integers that add to \(n\) is called a \terminology{partition}\index{partition of an integer} of \(n\). Thus the partitions of 3 are 1+1+1, 1+2 (which is the same as 2+1) and 3. The number of partitions of \(k\) is denoted by the \terminology{partition number} \(p(k)\); in computing the partitions of 3 we showed that \(p(3) = 3\). It is traditional to use Greek letters like \(\lambda\) to stand for partitions; we might write \(\lambda = 1,1,1\), \(\gamma= 2,1\) and \(\tau = 3\) to stand for the three partitions we just described. We also write \(\lambda = 1^3\) as a shorthand for \(\lambda = 1,1,1\), and we write \(\lambda \dashv 3\) as a shorthand for ``\(\lambda\) is a partition of three.''%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403346199472}%
There are 5 partitions of 4 (so \(p(4) = 5\)).  They are \(4=1+1+1+1\), \(4=2+1+1\), \(4=2+2\), \(4=3+1\), and \(4=4\).\end{example}

A \terminology{partition of the integer \(k\) into \(n\) parts}\index{partition of an integer!into \(n\) parts} is a multiset of \(n\) positive integers that add to \(k\). We use \(p_n(k)\) to denote the number of partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts. Thus \(p_n(k)\) is the number of ways to distribute \(k\) identical objects to \(n\) identical recipients so that each gets at least one.%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403346214944}%

When we write a partition as \(\lambda = \lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_n\), it is customary to write the list of \(\lambda_i\)s as a decreasing list. When we have a type vector \((t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_m)\) for a partition, we write either \(\lambda = 1^{t_1}2^{t_2}\cdots m^{t_m}\) or \(\lambda = m^{t_m}(m-1)^{t_{m-1}}\cdots 2^{t_2}1^{t_1}\). Henceforth we will use the second of these. When we write \(\lambda=\lambda_1^{i_1}\lambda_2^{i_2}\cdots\lambda_n^{i_n}\), we will assume that \(\lambda_i>\lambda_i+1\).%
\par
It is remarkable that there is no known formula for \(p_n(k)\), nor is there one for \(p(k)\). We have computed a few values of \(p_n(k)\) by listing partitions.  If we continue to do so, we could build a triangle of partition numbers as follows.%

So for example, \(p_3(7) = 4\): \((5,1,1)\), \((4,2,1)\), \((3,3,1)\), and \((3,2,2)\).  It sure would be nice to find the next row without having to list out all the partitions.  Perhaps we could use some sort of recursion!%
\par
With the binomial coefficients, with Stirling numbers of the second kind, and with the Lah numbers, we were able to find a recurrence by asking what happens to our subset, partition, or broken permutation of a set \(S\) of numbers if we remove the largest element of \(S\). Thus it is natural to look for a recurrence to count the number of partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts by doing something similar. Unfortunately, since we are counting distributions in which all the objects are identical, there is no way for us to identify a largest element. However if we think geometrically, we will be able to ``see'' how to get smaller partitions from larger.%

The decreasing list representation of partitions leads us to a handy way to visualize partitions. Given a decreasing list \((\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots \lambda_n)\), we draw a figure made up of rows of dots that has \(\lambda_1\) equally spaced dots in the first row, \(\lambda_2\) equally spaced dots in the second row, starting out right below the beginning of the first row and so on. Equivalently, instead of dots, we may use identical squares, drawn so that a square touches each one to its immediate right or immediately below it along an edge. See \hyperref[x:figure:FerrersYoung]{Figure~\ref{x:figure:FerrersYoung}} for examples.\index{Ferrers diagram}\index{Young diagram}\index{partition of an integer!Ferrers diagram}\index{partition of an integer!Young diagram}\index{diagram!of a partition!Ferrers}\index{diagram!of a partition!Young} The figure we draw with dots is called the \terminology{Ferrers diagram} of the partition; sometimes the figure with squares is also called a Ferrers diagram; sometimes it is called a \terminology{Young diagram}. At this stage it is irrelevant which name we choose and which kind of figure we draw; in more advanced work the squares are handy because we can put things like numbers or variables into them.  From now on we will use squares and call the diagrams Young diagrams.%

The natural way to get a partition of a smaller integer from a partition of \(n\) is to remove some of the squares from the Young diagram.  We lots of choices here.%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}We could remove the entire top row.%
\item{}We could remove the entire left-most column.%
\item{}We could remove a single box somewhere. But from where?%
\end{enumerate}
Removing the top row corresponds to removing the largest part of the partition.  Removing the left-most column corresponds to subtracting 1 from each part.  Removing a single box will reduce one part by 1.  Some of these might be more useful than others.%

The previous activity suggests a recurrence for \(p_n(k)\).  We might guess%
\begin{equation*}
p_n(k) = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i(k-n) = p_1(k-n) + p_2(k-n) + \cdots + p_n(k-n)\text{.}

For example,%
\begin{equation*}
p_4(9) = p_1(5) + p_2(5) + p_3(5)+ p_4(5) = 1+2+2+1 = 6

Suppose we wanted to compute \(p_5(13)\).  Since we have the 8th row of the partition number triangle, we should be able to do this with the long recursion.  What if we wanted to use the short recursion?%

Use the short recursion to compute \(p_5(13)\).  If you get a partition number that you don't yet know, use the short recursion to compute that as well (you know, the way you use recursions).%
\end{activity}
As you see above, the short recursion is nothing more than grouping all but the first term in the sum into a single partition number, using the long recursion again.  This should make sense based on the geometry of the Young digrams.%

The idea of conjugation of a partition could be defined without the geometric interpretation of a Young diagram, but it would seem far less natural without the geometric interpretation. Another idea that seems much more natural in a geometric context is this. Suppose we have a partition of \(k\) into \(n\) parts with largest part \(m\). Then the Young diagram of the partition can fit into a rectangle that is \(m\) or more units wide (horizontally) and \(n\) or more units deep. Suppose we place the Young diagram of our partition in the top left-hand corner of an \(m'\) unit wide and \(n'\) unit deep rectangle with \(m'\ge m\) and \(n' \ge n\), as in \hyperref[x:figure:complementpartition]{Figure~\ref{x:figure:complementpartition}}.%

Given a partition \(\lambda\) of 7 in decreasing list form \(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3\), if we add 0 to \(\lambda_3\), \(1\) to \(\lambda_2\) and 2 to \(\lambda_1\) the resulting partition of 10 has distinct parts. If we take a partition \(\lambda'\) of 10 with distinct parts, then \(\lambda'_1\ge\lambda'_2+1\), \(\lambda'_1\ge\lambda'_3+2\), and \(\lambda'_2\ge \lambda'_3+1\). Therefore if we subtract 2 from \(\lambda'_1\) to get \(\lambda_1\), subtract 1 from \(\lambda'_2\) to get \(\lambda_2\) and let \(\lambda_3= \lambda'_3\), then \(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3\) is the decreasing list representation of a partition of \(10-3=7\).

To start our journey into discrete mathematics, let's consider a few puzzles.%
\begin{investigation}{}{g:investigation:idp403346744976}%
In the time of Euler, in the town of Königsberg in Prussia, there was a river containing two islands. The islands were connected to the banks of the river by seven bridges (as seen below). The bridges were very beautiful, and on their days off, townspeople would spend time walking over the bridges. As time passed, a question arose: was it possible to plan a walk so that you cross each bridge once and only once? Euler was able to answer this question. Are you?%

\begin{investigation}{}{g:investigation:idp403346753776}%
Professor Nefario has invited 25 unsuspecting discrete math students to his estate for an evening of escape room fun.  Some of these students are already friends, but no student is friends with more than 3 other students.  The Professor wants to ensure that no friends are sent to the same escape room.  Can he be sure that four escape rooms will be enough?%

Is it possible that among the 25 students, everyone has \emph{exactly} three friends?%
\end{investigation}
\begin{investigation}{}{g:investigation:idp403346756912}%
Take a regular deck of 52 cards, shuffle well, and deal the cards into 13 piles.  Will it always be possible to select one card from each pile so that the 13 cards you select all have different values (ace, 2, 3, etc.)?%
\end{investigation}
All the puzzles above have a feature in common: they involve the ways in which individual (discrete) objects can be related to each other.  This is what graph theory studies, and we will see that each of the puzzles can be solved with the tools of the subject.  Before we start developing those tools, take a moment to see why graphs are applicable to these problems.%
\par
In the bridges of Königsberg puzzle, all that really matters is which land masses are connected by bridges, and how many bridges connect them.  The length of the bridges and size of the land masses is unimportant.  So we can represent this puzzle with a graph like this:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0.375}{0.375}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{0.25}%
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{%
          \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9, yscale=.5]
\draw (-1,-2) \v to [out=120, in=240] (-1,0) \v to [out=120, in=240] (-1,2) \v to [out=300, in=60] (-1,0) to [out=300, in=60] (-1,-2);
\draw (1,0) \v -- (-1,2) (-1,0) -- (1,0) -- (-1,-2);
\end{tikzpicture}
}%
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
Now we must decide whether it is possible to travel around that graph in a way that each edge is crossed exactly once.%
\par
When it comes to friendship, if we assume that it is always reciprocated, we can represent the people as vertices and connect two vertices with an edge if the people they represent are friends.  We can ask whether it is possible to have such a graph in which each vertex is incident to exactly three edges or whether it is possible to ``color'' the vertices with just four colors so that no pair of same colored vertices are adjacent (connected by an edge).%
\par
If we have thirteen piles of cards, we represent each pile as a vertex and each value as a vertex, and connect a pile vertex to a value vertex precisely when that value is in the pile.  We could then ask whether we could select a collection of thirteen edges that do not share any single vertex.%
\par
These puzzles give you just a small glimpse into the myriad of applications graph theory can address.  For us, we will use our study of graph theory to see how reasoning in discrete mathematics works and as an excuse to remind ourselves of the basic mathematical objects and proof techniques required to study the subject in general.%

You might also think of a graph as a set of vertices and a set of edges, where each edge is a set of two vertices. Are the graphs below the same or different?%
\begin{description}
\item[{Graph 1:}]\(V = \{a, b, c, d, e\}\),%
\par
\(E = \{\{a,b\}, \{a, c\}, \{a,d\}, \{a,e\}, \{b,c\}, \{d,e\}\}\).%
\item[{Graph 2:}]\(V = \{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\}\),%
\par
\(E = \{\{v_1, v_3\}, \{v_1, v_5\}, \{v_2, v_4\}, \{v_2, v_5\}, \{v_3, v_5\}, \{v_4, v_5\}\}\).%
\end{description}
%
\end{activity}
Before we start studying graphs, we need to agree upon what a graph is.  		While we almost always think of graphs as pictures (dots connected by lines) this is fairly ambiguous.  Do the lines need to be straight?  Does it matter how long the lines are or how large the dots are?  Can there be two lines connecting the same pair of dots?  Can one line connect three dots?%
\par
The way we avoid ambiguities in mathematics is to provide concrete and rigorous \emph{definitions}.  Crafting good definitions is not easy, but it is incredibly important.  The definition is the agreed upon starting point from which all truths in mathematics proceed.  Is there a graph with no edges?  We have to look at the definition to see if this is possible.%
\par
We want our definition to be precise and unambiguous, but it also must agree with our intuition for the objects we are studying.  It needs to be useful: we \emph{could} define a graph to be a six legged mammal, but that would not let us solve any problems about bridges.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403346817184}%
Write a definition for a \emph{graph}.  Make sure that your definition can be helpful in making sense of \hyperref[x:activity:activity-graphdiff]{Activity~\ref{x:activity:activity-graphdiff}}.%
\end{activity}
Writing definitions is hard.  You should compare what you came up with to the following:%
\begin{definition}{}{g:definition:idp403346819936}%
A \terminology{graph} is an ordered pair \(G = (V, E)\) consisting of a nonempty set \(V\) (called the \terminology{vertices}) and a set \(E\) (called the \terminology{edges}) of two-element subsets of \(V\).%
\end{definition}
Strange.  Nowhere in the definition is there talk of dots or lines.  From the definition, a graph could be%
\begin{equation*}
(\{a,b,c,d\}, \{\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{b,d\}, \{c,d\}\}).
\end{equation*}
Here we have a graph with four vertices  (the letters \(a, b, c, d\)) and four edges (the pairs \(\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{b,d\}, \{c,d\})\)).%
\par
Looking at sets and sets of 2-element sets is difficult to process.  That is why we often draw a representation of these sets.  We put a dot down for each vertex, and connect two dots with a line precisely when those two vertices are one of the 2-element subsets in our set of edges.  Thus one way to draw the graph described above is this:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0.375}{0.375}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{0.25}%
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{%
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
   \draw  (-1,1) \vl{\(a\)} -- (1,1) \vr{\(b\)} (-1,1) -- (-1,-1) \vl{\(c\)} -- (1,-1) \vr{\(d\)} -- (1,1) -- (-1,-1);
 \end{tikzpicture}
}%
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
However we could also have drawn the graph differently. For example either of these:%
\begin{sidebyside}{2}{0.1375}{0.1375}{0.275}%
\begin{sbspanel}{0.2}[bottom]%
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{%
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
   \draw  (-1,1) \vl{\(a\)} -- (1,-1) \vr{\(b\)} (-1,1) -- (-1,-1) \vl{\(c\)} -- (1,1) \vr{\(d\)} -- (1,-1) -- (-1,-1);
 \end{tikzpicture}
}%
\end{sbspanel}%
\begin{sbspanel}{0.25}[bottom]%
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{%
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
   \draw  (-1.5,0) \vb{\(a\)} -- (-.5,0) \vb{\(b\)} (-1.5,0) .. controls (-.5,1) .. (.5,0) \vb{\(c\)} -- (1.5,0) \vb{\(d\)} .. controls (.5,1) .. (-.5,0) -- (.5,0);
 \end{tikzpicture}
}%
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
We should be careful about what it means for two graphs to be ``the same.''  Actually, given our definition, this is easy: Are the vertex sets equal?  Are the edge sets equal?  We know what it means for sets to be equal, and graphs are nothing but a pair of two special sorts of sets.%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403346832976}%
Are the graphs below equal?%
\begin{equation*}
G_1 = (\{a,b,c\}, \{\{a,b\}, \{b,c\}\}); \qquad G_2 = (\{a,b,c\}, \{\{a,c\}, \{c, b\}\})
\end{equation*}
equal?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403346834576}{}\quad{}No.  Here the vertex sets of each graph are equal, which is a good start.  Also, both graphs have two edges.  In the first graph, we have edges \(\{a,b\}\) and \(\{b,c\}\), while in the second graph we have edges	\(\{a,c\}\) and 	\(\{c,b\}\).  Now we do have \(\{b,c\} = \{c,b\}\), so that is not the problem.  The issue is that \(\{a,b\} \ne \{a,c\}\).  Since the edge sets of the two graphs are not equal (as sets), the graphs are not equal (as graphs).%
\end{example}
Even if two graphs are not \emph{equal}, they might be \emph{basically} the same. The graphs in the previous example could be drawn like this:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0.2}{0.2}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{0.6}%
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{%
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\draw (-3,0) \vb{\footnotesize $a$} -- (-2,0) \vb{\footnotesize $b$} -- (-1,0) \vb{\footnotesize $c$}  (3,0) \vb{\footnotesize $b$} -- (2,0) \vb{\footnotesize $c$} -- (1,0) \vb{$\footnotesize a$};
	\node[above] at (-3,.5) {$G_1$} ;
	\node[above] at (1, .5) {$G_2$};
\end{tikzpicture}
}%
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
Graphs that are basically the same (but perhaps not equal) are called \terminology{isomorphic}. We will give a precise definition of this term after a quick example:%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403346842656}%
Consider the graphs:%
\begin{quote}%
\(G_1 = \{V_1, E_1\}\) where \(V_1 = \{a, b, c\}\) and \(E_1 = \{\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}\}\);%
\par
\(G_2 = \{V_2, E_2\}\) where \(V_2 = \{u,v,w\}\) and \(E_2 = \{\{u,v\}, \{u,w\}, \{v,w\}\}\).%
\end{quote}
Are these graphs the same?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403346848032}{}\quad{}The two graphs are NOT equal. It is enough to notice that \(V_1 \ne V_2\) since \(a \in V_1\) but \(a \notin V_2\). However, both of these graphs consist of three vertices with edges connecting every pair of vertices. We can draw them as follows:%
\begin{sidebyside}{2}{0.125}{0.125}{0.25}%

Clearly we want to say these graphs are basically the same, so while they are not equal, they will be \emph{isomorphic}. The reason is we can rename the vertices of one graph and get the second graph as the result.%
\end{example}
Intuitively, graphs are \terminology{isomorphic} \index{isomorphic} if they are basically the same, or better yet, if they are the same except for the names of the vertices. To make the concept of renaming vertices precise, we give the following definitions:%
\begin{definition}{}{g:definition:idp403346856144}%
\index{isomorphic} An \terminology{isomorphism}\index{isomorphism} between two graphs \(G_1\) and \(G_2\) is a bijection \(f:V_1 \to V_2\) between the vertices of the graphs such that \(\{a,b\}\) is an edge in \(G_1\) if and only if \(\{f(a), f(b)\}\) is an edge in \(G_2\).%
\par
Two graphs are \terminology{isomorphic} if there is an isomorphism between them. In this case we write \(G_1 \isom G_2\).%
\end{definition}
An isomorphism is simply a function which renames the vertices. It must be a bijection so every vertex gets a new name. These newly named vertices must be connected by edges precisely if they were connected by edges with their old names.%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403346863488}%
Decide whether the graphs \(G_1 = \{V_1, E_1\}\) and \(G_2 = \{V_2, E_2\}\) are equal or isomorphic.%
\par
\(V_1 = \{a,b,c,d\}\), \(E_1 = \{\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{a,d\}, \{c,d\}\}\)%
\par
\(V_2 = \{a,b,c,d\}\), \(E_2 = \{\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{c,d\}\}\)%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403346867968}{}\quad{}The graphs are NOT equal, since \(\{a,d\} \in E_1\) but \(\{a,d\} \notin E_2\). However, since both graphs contain the same number of vertices and same number of edges, they \emph{might} be isomorphic (this is not enough in most cases, but it is a good start).%
\par
We can try to build an isomorphism. How about we say \(f(a) = b\), \(f(b) = c\), \(f(c) = d\) and \(f(d) = a\). This is definitely a bijection, but to make sure that the function is an isomorphism, we must make sure it \emph{respects the edge relation}. In \(G_1\), vertices \(a\) and \(b\) are connected by an edge. In \(G_2\), \(f(a) = b\) and \(f(b) = c\) are connected by an edge. So far, so good, but we must check the other three edges. The edge \(\{a,c\}\) in \(G_1\) corresponds to \(\{f(a), f(c)\} = \{b,d\}\), but here we have a problem. There is no edge between \(b\) and \(d\) in \(G_2\). Thus \(f\) is NOT an isomorphism.%
\par
Not all hope is lost, however. Just because \(f\) is not an isomorphism does not mean that there is no isomorphism at all. We can try again. At this point it might be helpful to draw the graphs to see how they should match up.%

Alternatively, notice that in \(G_1\), the vertex \(a\) is adjacent to every other vertex. In \(G_2\), there is also a vertex with this property: \(c\). So build the bijection \(g:V_1 \to V_2\) by defining \(g(a) = c\) to start with. Next, where should we send \(b\)? In \(G_1\), the vertex \(b\) is only adjacent to vertex \(a\). There is exactly one vertex like this in \(G_2\), namely \(d\). So let \(g(b) = d\). As for the last two, in this example, we have a free choice: let \(g(c) = b\) and \(g(d) = a\) (switching these would be fine as well).%
\par
We should check that this really is an isomorphism. It is definitely a bijection. We must make sure that the edges are respected. The four edges in \(G_1\) are%
\begin{equation*}
\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{a,d\}, \{c,d\}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Under the proposed isomorphism these become%
\begin{equation*}
\{g(a), g(b)\}, \{g(a), g(c)\}, \{g(a), g(d)\}, \{g(c), g(d)\}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
\{c,d\}, \{c,b\}, \{c,a\}, \{b,a\}
\end{equation*}
which are precisely the edges in \(G_2\). Thus \(g\) is an isomorphism, so \(G_1 \cong G_2\)%
\end{example}
Sometimes we will talk about a graph with a special name (like \(K_n\) or the \emph{Peterson graph}) or perhaps draw a graph without any labels. In this case we are really referring to \emph{all} graphs isomorphic to any copy of that particular graph. A collection of isomorphic graphs is often called an \terminology{isomorphism class}\index{isomorphism class}.\footnote{This is not unlike geometry, where we might have more than one copy of a particular triangle. There instead of \emph{isomorphic} we say \emph{congruent}.\label{g:fn:idp403346897248}}%

We would like to say that the smaller graph is a \emph{subgraph} of the larger.%
\par
We should give a careful definition of this.  In fact, there are two reasonable notions for what a subgroup should mean.%
\begin{definition}{}{g:definition:idp403346972528}%
We say that \(G' = (V', E')\) is a \terminology{subgraph}\index{subgraph} of \(G = (V, E)\), and write \(G' \subseteq G\), provided \(V' \subseteq V\) and \(E' \subseteq E\).%
\par
We say that \(G' = (V', E')\) is an \terminology{induced subgraph}\index{subgraph!induced}\index{induced subgraph} of \(G = (V, E)\) provided \(V' \subseteq V\) and every edge in \(E\) whose vertices are still in \(V'\) is also an edge in \(E'\).%
\end{definition}
Notice that every induced subgraph is also an ordinary subgraph, but not conversely.  Think of a subgraph as the result of deleting some vertices and edges from the larger graph.  For the subgraph to be an induced subgraph, we can still delete vertices, but now we only delete those edges that included the deleted vertices.%

Here both \(G_2\) and \(G_3\) are subgraphs of \(G_1\).  But only \(G_2\) is an \emph{induced} subgraph.  Every edge in \(G_1\) that connects vertices in \(G_2\) is also an edge in \(G_2\).  In \(G_3\), the edge \(\{a,b\}\) is in \(E_1\) but not \(E_3\), even though vertices \(a\) and \(b\) are in \(V_3\).%
\par
The graph \(G_4\) is NOT a subgraph of \(G_1\), even though it looks like all we did is remove vertex \(e\).  The reason is that in \(E_4\) we have the edge \(\{c,f\}\) but this is not an element of \(E_1\), so we don't have the required 	\(E_4 \subseteq E_1\).%
\end{example}
Back to some basic graph theory definitions. Notice that all the graphs we have drawn above have the property that no pair of vertices is connected more than once, and no vertex is connected to itself. Graphs like these are sometimes called \terminology{simple}, although we will just call them \emph{graphs}. This is because our definition for a graph says that the edges form a set of 2-element subsets of the vertices. Remember that it doesn't make sense to say a set contains an element more than once. So no pair of vertices can be connected by an edge more than once. Also, since each edge must be a set containing two vertices, we cannot have a single vertex connected to itself by an edge.%
\par
That said, there are times we want to consider double (or more) edges and single edge loops. For example, the ``graph'' we drew for the Bridges of Königsberg problem had double edges because there really are two bridges connecting a particular island to the near shore. We will call these objects \terminology{multigraphs}\index{multigraph}. This is a good name: a \emph{multiset} is a set in which we are allowed to include a single element multiple times.%
\par
The graphs above are also \terminology{connected}\index{connected}: you can get from any vertex to any other vertex by following some path of edges. A graph that is not connected can be thought of as two separate graphs drawn close together. For example, the following graph is NOT connected because there is no path from \(a\) to \(b\):%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0.335}{0.335}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{0.33}%
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{%
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\draw (-1.5,0) \vl{\footnotesize $a$} -- (-.5, 1) \v -- (.5, 0) \v -- (-.5,-1) \v -- cycle;
	\draw (-.5,0) \v -- (.5,1) \v -- (1.5,0) \vr{\footnotesize $b$} -- (.5,-1) \v -- cycle;
\end{tikzpicture}
}%
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
Most of the time, it makes sense to treat non-connected graphs as separate graphs (think of the above graph as two squares), so unless otherwise stated, we will assume all our graphs are connected.%
\par
Vertices in a graph do not always have edges between them. If we add all possible edges, then the resulting graph is called \terminology{complete}\index{complete graph}. That is, a graph is complete if every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. Since a graph is determined completely by which vertices are adjacent to which other vertices, there is only one complete graph with a given number of vertices. We give these a special name: \(K_n\)\label{g:notation:idp403347010640} is the complete graph on \(n\) vertices.%
\par
Each vertex in \(K_n\) is adjacent to \(n-1\) other vertices. We call the number of edges emanating from a given vertex the \terminology{degree} of that vertex. So every vertex in \(K_n\) has degree \(n-1\). How many edges does \(K_n\) have? One might think the answer should be \(n(n-1)\), since we count \(n-1\) edges \(n\) times (once for each vertex). However, each edge is incident to 2 vertices, so we counted every edge exactly twice. Thus there are \(n(n-1)/2\) edges in \(K_n\). %
\par
In general, if we know the degrees of all the vertices in a graph, we can find the number of edges. The sum of the degrees of all vertices will always be \emph{twice} the number of edges, since each edge adds to the degree of two vertices. Notice this means that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in any graph must be even!%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403347019824}%
At a recent math seminar, 9 mathematicians greeted each other by shaking hands. Is it possible that each mathematician shook hands with exactly 7 people at the seminar?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403347021040}{}\quad{}It seems like this should be possible. Each mathematician chooses one person to not shake hands with. But this cannot happen. We are asking whether a graph with 9 vertices can have each vertex have degree 7. If such a graph existed, the sum of the degrees of the vertices would be \(9\cdot 7 = 63\). This would be twice the number of edges (handshakes) resulting in a graph with \(31.5\) edges. That is impossible. Thus at least one (in fact an odd number) of the mathematicians must have shaken hands with an \emph{even} number of people at the seminar.%
\end{example}
One final definition: we say a graph is \terminology{bipartite}\index{bipartite} if the vertices can be divided into two sets, \(A\) and \(B\), with no two vertices in \(A\) adjacent and no two vertices in \(B\) adjacent. The vertices in \(A\) can be adjacent to some or all of the vertices in \(B\). If each vertex in \(A\) is adjacent to all the vertices in \(B\), then the graph is a \terminology{complete bipartite graph}, and gets a special name: \(K_{m,n}\), where \(|A| = m\) and \(|B| = n\). The graph in the houses and utilities puzzle is \(K_{3,3}\).%

\begin{description}
\item[{Graph}]\index{graph} A collection of \terminology{vertices}, some of which are connected by \terminology{edges}. More precisely, a pair of sets \(V\) and \(E\) where \(V\) is a set of vertices and \(E\) is a set of 2-element subsets of \(V\).%
\item[{Adjacent}]\index{adjacent} Two vertices are \terminology{adjacent} if they are connected by an edge. Two edges are \terminology{adjacent} if they share a vertex.%
\item[{Bipartite graph}]\index{bipartite} A graph for which it is possible to divide the vertices into two disjoint sets such that there are no edges between any two vertices in the same set.%
\item[{Complete bipartite graph}]A bipartite graph for which every vertex in the first set is adjacent to every vertex in the second set.%
\item[{Complete graph}]\index{complete graph} A graph in which every pair of vertices is adjacent.%
\item[{Connected}]\index{connected} A graph is \terminology{connected} if there is a path from any vertex to any other vertex.%
\item[{Chromatic number}]\index{chromatic number} The minimum number of colors required in a proper vertex coloring of the graph.%
\item[{Cycle}]\index{cycle} A path (see below) that starts and stops at the same vertex, but contains no other repeated vertices.%
\item[{Degree of a vertex}]\index{degree} The number of edges incident to a vertex.%
\item[{Euler path}]A walk which uses each edge exactly once.%
\item[{Euler circuit}]\index{Euler path} An Euler path which starts and stops at the same vertex.%
\item[{Multigraph}]\index{multigraph} A \terminology{multigraph} is just like a graph but can contain multiple edges between two vertices as well as single edge loops (that is an edge from a vertex to itself).%
\item[{Path}]\index{path}A \terminology{path} is a walk that doesn't repeat any vertices (or edges) except perhaps the first and last.  If a path starts and ends at the same vertex, it is called a \terminology{cycle}.%
\item[{Planar}]\index{planar} A graph which can be drawn (in the plane) without any edges crossing.%
\item[{Subgraph}]\index{subgraph} We say that \(H\) is a \terminology{subgraph} of \(G\) if every vertex and edge of \(H\) is also a vertex or edge of \(G\). We say \(H\) is an \terminology{induced} subgraph of \(G\) if every vertex of \(H\) is a vertex of \(G\) and each pair of vertices in \(H\) are adjacent in \(H\) if and only if they are adjacent in \(G\).%

How might you use graph theory to solve the puzzle above?  One thing to try would be to create a graph consisting of six vertices, one for each value that appears on the dominoes.  Then connect the vertices if their numbers belong to the same domino.  This seems reasonable, but then how would you represent the line of matched up dominoes the puzzle requests?%
\par
Say you start with domino \((4,6)\).  That is an edge in our graph.  Next we need to place a domino with a 6 on it (or a 4, but let's say the 4 will be an endpoint).  This amounts to selecting another edge, one that is incident to the vertex 6.  Say we pick \((6,5)\).  The edge we must select after that will need to be incident to vertex 5.  And so on.%
\par
The edges we select in the graph need to be linked up.  It makes sense to think about the selection of edges as traveling through the graph, moving along edges from vertex to vertex.  Let's capture this notion carefully.%
\begin{definition}{}{x:definition:def-walk}%
\index{walk}%
\index{trail}%
\index{path}%
\index{circuit}%
\index{cycle}%
A \terminology{walk} in a graph \(G = (V,E)\) is a sequence of vertices \(v_0, v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\) such that \(\{v_i, v_{i+1}\} \in E\) for all \(0 \le i \lt n\).  That is, consecutive vertices in the sequence are adjacent in the graph.%
\par
A \terminology{trail} is a walk that does not repeat any edges.  If the trail starts and ends at the same vertex (i.e., \(v_1 = v_n\)) then it is called a \terminology{circuit}%
\par
A \terminology{path} is a trail that does not repeat any vertices, except perhaps for \(v_0 = v_n\).  In the case that \(v_0 = v_n\), the path is called a \terminology{cycle}.%
\end{definition}
Do these definitions capture what a walk\slash{}trail\slash{}path should mean in a graph?  All three of these describe ways in which to move around in the graph, perhaps tracing along the edges without lifting up your pencil.%
\par
Note: some sources give slightly different definitions for these concepts.  For example, sometimes a walk is defined as a alternating sequence of vertices and edges \(v_1e_1v_2e_2v_3\cdots e_{n-1}v_n\) with the requirement that \(v_i\) is incident to \(e_i\), which is incident to \(v_{i+1}\).  We have not named our edges, so this definition would not make sense.  Another common way to define \emph{path} is as a subgraph isomorphic to \(P_n\) for some \(n\).  This is almost equivalent to our definition, except that we allow our paths to possibly be isomorphic to \(C_n\) for some \(n\) as well.  Some sources use \emph{path} where we use \emph{walk} and use \emph{simple path} where we use \emph{path}.%
\par
Walks and paths are useful for considering all sorts of graph theoretic concepts.  For example, you might want to find the \terminology{distance} between two vertices.  This would be defined as the shortest path starting at one and ending at the other (where the \terminology{length} of a path is the number of edges in it).  If you have a notion of distance, you can define the \emph{center} and \emph{radius} of a graph.  Graphs are \emph{connected} provided between any two vertices, there is a path (or equivalently, a walk).%

To solve the domino problem, as well as the Bridges of Königsberg, we need to consider walks that use every edge exactly once.%
\begin{definition}{}{x:definition:def-eulerpath}%
A walk in a graph that uses every edge exactly once is called an \terminology{Euler path}.  An Euler path that starts and ends at the same vertex is called an \terminology{Euler circuit}.%
\end{definition}
Although it is tradition, \emph{Euler path} is a bad name.  These should be called an \terminology{Euler trail} or \terminology{Euler walk}, since by our definitions, an Euler path is usually not a path at all.  An Euler circuit is also sometimes called an \terminology{Euler tour}.%

So what does it take for a graph to have an Euler path or circuit?  Of course if a graph is not connected, there is no hope of finding such a path or circuit. For the rest of this section, assume all the graphs discussed are connected.%
\par
The bridges of Königsberg problem is really a question about the existence of Euler paths. There will be a route that crosses every bridge exactly once if and only if the multigraph below has an Euler path:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0.39}{0.39}{0}%

\par
This graph is small enough that we could actually check every possible walk that does not reuse edges, and in doing so convince ourselves that there is no Euler path (let alone an Euler circuit). On small graphs which do have an Euler path, it is usually not difficult to find one. Our goal is to find a quick way to check whether a graph has an Euler path or circuit, even if the graph is quite large.%
\par
One way to guarantee that a graph does \emph{not} have an Euler circuit is to include a ``spike,'' a vertex of degree 1.%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0.385}{0.385}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{0.23}%
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{%
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw (-1,0) \v -- (0,1) \v -- (1,0) \v -- cycle;
    \draw (0,1) -- (1,1) \v node[below right]{\(a\)};
   \end{tikzpicture}
}%
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
The vertex \(a\) has degree 1, and if you try to make an Euler circuit, you see that you will get stuck at the vertex. It is a dead end. That is, unless you start there. But then there is no way to return, so there is no hope of finding an Euler circuit. There is however an Euler path. It starts at the vertex \(a\), then loops around the triangle. You will end at the vertex of degree 3.%
\par
You run into a similar problem whenever you have a vertex of any odd degree. If you start at such a vertex, you will not be able to end there (after traversing every edge exactly once). After using one edge to leave the starting vertex, you will be left with an even number of edges emanating from the vertex. Half of these could be used for returning to the vertex, the other half for leaving. So you return, then leave. Return, then leave. The only way to use up all the edges is to use the last one by leaving the vertex. On the other hand, if you have a vertex with odd degree that you do not start a path at, then you will eventually get stuck at that vertex. The path will use pairs of edges incident to the vertex to arrive and leave again. Eventually all but one of these edges will be used up, leaving only an edge to arrive by, and none to leave again.%
\par
What all this says is that if a graph has an Euler path and two vertices with odd degree, then the Euler path must start at one of the odd degree vertices and end at the other. In such a situation, every other vertex \emph{must} have an even degree since we need an equal number of edges to get to those vertices as to leave them. How could we have an Euler circuit? The graph could not have any odd degree vertex as an Euler path would have to start there or end there, but not both. Thus for a graph to have an Euler circuit, all vertices must have even degree.%
\par
So there is clearly a connection between the parity of vertex degrees and Euler paths and circuits.  Here are two theorems the describe that connection.%
\begin{theorem}{}{}{x:theorem:thm-eulercircuit}%
A connected graph has an Euler circuit if and only if the degree of every vertex is even.%
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}{}{}{x:theorem:thm-eulerpath}%
A connected graph has an Euler path if and only if there are at most two vertices with odd degree.%
\end{theorem}
Note that these theorems answer the bridges of Königsberg problem.  The graph has all four vertices with odd degree, there is no Euler path through the graph.  Thus there is no way for the townspeople to cross every bridge exactly once.%

The other direction is harder.  If you know every vertex has even degree, you must now show there is an Euler circuit.  One thing you could do is to give a procedure for building one.

The graph on the right does not have a Hamilton path.  You would need to visit each of the ``outside'' vertices, but as soon as you visit one, you get stuck.  Note that this graph does not have an Euler path, although there are graphs with Euler paths but no Hamilton paths.%
\end{example}
It appears that finding Hamilton paths would be easier because graphs often have more edges than vertices, so there are fewer requirements to be met. However, nobody knows whether this is true. There is no known simple test for whether a graph has a Hamilton path. For small graphs this is not a problem, but as the size of the graph grows, it gets harder and harder to check whether there is a Hamilton path. In fact, this is an example of a question which as far as we know is too difficult for computers to solve; it is an example of a problem which is NP-complete\index{NP-complete}.%

When is it possible to draw a graph so that none of the edges cross? If this \emph{is} possible, we say the graph is \terminology{planar}\index{planar} (since you can draw it on the \emph{plane}).%

\par
The graphs are the same, so if one is planar, the other must be too. However, the original drawing of the graph was not a \terminology{planar representation} of the graph.%
\par
When a planar graph is drawn without edges crossing, the edges and vertices of the graph divide the plane into regions. We will call each region a \terminology{face}\index{faces}. The graph above has 3 faces (yes, we \emph{do} include the ``outside'' region as a face). The number of faces does not change no matter how you draw the graph (as long as you do so without the edges crossing), so it makes sense to ascribe the number of faces as a property of the planar graph.%
\par
WARNING: you can only count faces when the graph is drawn in a planar way. For example, consider these two representations of the same graph:%
\begin{sidebyside}{2}{0.1375}{0.1375}{0.275}%
\begin{sbspanel}{0.2}[bottom]%
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{%
\begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw (45:1) \v -- (135:1) \v -- (225:1) \v -- (315:1) \v -- (45:1) -- (225:1) (135:1) -- (315:1);

      \draw (135:1) .. controls (70:2) and (20:2) .. (315:1);
    \end{tikzpicture}
}%
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
If you try to count faces using the graph on the left, you might say there are 5 faces (including the outside). But drawing the graph with a planar representation shows that in fact there are only 4 faces.%
\par
Is there a connection between the number of vertices (\(v\)), the number of edges (\(e\)) and the number of faces (\(f\)) in any connected planar graph?  Let's investigate this.  For each planar graph, we can associate a triple \((v,e,f)\) containing the number of vertices, edges and faces.  For example, the triple for \(K_4\) drawn above is \((4,6,4)\).%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403347287968}%
Draw a lot of planar graphs and for each record the triple \((v,e,f)\).  What triples are possible? Is there a graph with the triple \((5, 9, 6)\)?  What about \((5,7,5)\)?%
\end{activity}
If we want to understand the relationship between the number of vertices, edges and faces of a planar graph, we could first try to decide which triples can be realized by a graph and which cannot.  At first this might seem like a daunting task.  The key is to think of it recursively.  Perhaps start with simple graphs and build up to more complicated ones.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403347291360}%
What happens to the triple \((v,e,f)\) when you add an edge to a graph?%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}Start with a single pair of adjacent vertices (that is, the graph \(P_1\)).  What is \((v,e,f)\)?  What happens to the triple if you extend the path to \(P_2\)?  How do \(v\), \(e\), and \(f\) change?%
\item{}You could add another vertex and edge to \(P_2\) (which would either give \(P_3\) or a \emph{star} graph), or you could add an edge connecting two vertices not already adjacent.  What would these two operations do to \((v,e,f)\)?%
\item{}Generalize.  Say you know a specific triple \((a,b,c)\) describes a graph \(G\).  Give two new triples that also describe some graphs, each with one more edge than \(G\).%
\item{}Conjecture a relationship between \(v\), \(e\), and \(f\) that should hold for any connected planar graph.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
It appears that whenever \((v,e,f)\) describes some graph, then there is a graph with triple \((v+1, e+1, f)\) and a graph with triple \((v,e+1, f+1)\).  Perhaps there are other ways we could add an edge we haven't thought of yet, but so far it seems like this completely describes how any triple must be created.%
\par
If this is the case, what could we conclude?  Every time we add an edge, either the number of vertices or the number of faces increases by 1.  Perhaps then \(e = v + f\)?  But this is not true, since for \(P_1\) we would have \(1 = 2 + 1\), clearly false.  Okay, at least we might guess \(v + f - e\) is constant.  And from \(P_1\), we see that constant would need to be \(2 + 1 - 1 = 2\).  This leads us to conjecture the following theorem.%
\begin{theorem}{}{}{x:theorem:thm-eulerformula}%
For any planar graph with \(v\) vertices, \(e\) edges, and \(f\) faces, we have%
\begin{equation*}
v - e + f = 2
\end{equation*}
%
\end{theorem}
We will soon see that this really is a theorem.  The equation \(v-e+f = 2\) is called \terminology{Euler's formula for planar graphs}.  To prove this, we will want to somehow capture the idea of building up more complicated graphs from simpler ones.  That is a job for mathematical induction!%

The proof technique we will use to establish Euler's formula for planar graphs is called \terminology{mathematical induction}.  This is a technique we use many times throughout our studies, so let's take a few moments to understand the logical structure for this style of proof and why it is a valid proof technique.  Additional general practice on induction can be found in \hyperref[x:section:sec_background-induction]{Section~\ref{x:section:sec_background-induction}}.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403347317776}%
What is the units digit of \(6^n\)?  How do you know?%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}Suppose you knew that the units digit of \(6^{217}\) was a 2.  Without calculating \(6^{218}\) directly, can you say what its units digit would be?%
\item{}Is the units digit of \(6^{217}\) a 2?  How do you know?%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
We often wish to prove a statement is true for all natural numbers \(n\) (or all integers larger than some smallest example).  Mathematical induction uses the fact that the (infinitely many) cases we wish to prove are in a nice order with a least element.  To show that \(6^n\) has units digit 6 for all \(n \ge 1\), we notice that \(6^n = 6^{n-1}\cdot 6\).  Assuming that we have already shown that \(6^{n-1}\) has units digit 6, we can multiply this number by 6, and note that the units digit will still be a 6, since the units digit of \(x \cdot 6\) is just 6 times the units digit of \(x\), and \(6\cdot 6\) has units digit 6.%
\par
But this seems sneaky.  Is it valid to assume that we already know the units digit of \(6^{n-1}\)?  That is the power of induction.%
\par
Suppose we hope to prove that \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 0\).  What we will really prove is that \(P(0)\) is true, and that for all \(k\), if \(P(k-1)\) is true, then \(P(k)\) is true.  In other words, we are proving the implication%
\begin{equation*}
\forall k \,(P(k) \imp P(k+1)).
\end{equation*}
This implication being true for all \(k \ge 1\) really means we have proved infinitely many implications%
\begin{gather*}
P(0) \imp P(1)\\
P(1) \imp P(2)\\
P(2) \imp P(3)\\
\vdots
\end{gather*}
%
\par
Can we conclude \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n\)?  Well take any \(n\).  For example, \(n = 3\).  We know \(P(0)\) is true, and the implication \(P(0) \imp P(1)\) is true, so we can conclude \(P(1)\).  From \(P(1)\) and \(P(1) \imp P(2)\), we can conclude \(P(2)\).  From \(P(2)\) and \(P(2) \imp P(3)\), we can conclude \(P(3)\).  If we wanted a different value of \(n\), we would just need to keep going until we got up to it.  Since every value of \(n\) can be reached by some finite number of steps starting at 0, we will know, for each \(n\) that \(P(n)\) is true.%
\par
The above discussion is meant to explain why it is reasonable to believe that induction is a valid proof technique.\footnote{Technically, induction must be assumed as an axiom or deduced from the equivalent well-ordering principle which says that every subset of \(\N\) contains a least element; our justification for it is circular, since to prove the justification is valid would be done by induction itself.\label{g:fn:idp403347342672}}  Once we believe induction works, we can just use it.  That means just proving two things: \(P(0)\) and for all \(n \ge 0\), \(P(n) \imp P(n+1)\).  We call \(P(0)\) the \terminology{base case} and the implication the \terminology{inductive case}.  Here is an example of what a proof by induction looks like.%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403347346768}%
Prove by induction that for all \(n \ge 0\), the number \(n^2 + n\) is even.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403347348752}{}\quad{}First note that induction is NOT necessary here.  We could give a non-inductive prove as follows.%
\begin{proofptx}{}{g:proof:idp403347349520}
Fix \(n \ge 0\).  Now \(n^2 + n = n(n+1)\).  Either \(n\) or \((n+1)\) is even, and the product of an even number and an odd number is even, so \(n^2 + n\) is even.%
\end{proofptx}
To contrast, here is a proof by induction.%
\begin{proofptx}{}{g:proof:idp403347353056}
First note that \(0^2 + 0 = 0\) is even, so the case when \(n = 0\) is true.  Now assume for an arbitrary \(n\ge 0\) that \(n^2 + n\) is even.  Consider the case for \(n+1\):%
\begin{align*}
(n+1)^2 + n+1 \amp = n^2 + 2n + 1 + n + 1\\
\amp = n^2 + n + 2n + 2.
\end{align*}
But \(n^2 + n\) is even, and \(2n + 2\) is even, and the sum of two even numbers is even, so \((n+1)^2 + n+1\) is even.%
\end{proofptx}
\end{example}
Now that we have some sense for mathematical induction in general, let's consider how induction can be applied in graph theory.%
\par
First, we need something to play the role of \(n\), since induction is used to prove statements are true for all natural numbers \(n\).  For the most part, we cannot think of all graphs as lined up in some natural order.  But we could use induction \emph{on} the number of edges of a graph (or number of vertices, or any other notion of size).  That is we can prove that for all \(n\ge 0\), all graphs with \(n\) edges have \textellipsis{}.%
\par
Notice that the thing we are proving for all \(n\) is itself a universally quantified statement. This means that our base case become, ``for all graphs with 0 edges \textellipsis{}'' (which for not-necessarily connected graphs is infinitely many graphs).  To prove the inductive case we \emph{get to} assume that for all graphs with \(n\) edges \textellipsis{}, but then we \emph{must} prove that for all graphs with \(n+1\) edges \textellipsis{}.%
\par
Because of this added complication, the usual way to approach the inductive case for graphs is to start with an arbitrary graph that has \(n+1\) edges.  Then remove an edge to drop down to a graph with \(n\) edges, which we know something about (our inductive hypothesis).  Then make sure that moving back to the original graph, we maintain our desired property.%
\par
Let's try a simple example.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403347368336}%
Recall that a \terminology{tree} is a connected graph with no cycles.  We wish to prove that every tree with \(v = n\) vertices has \(e = n-1\) edges.  (This is actually a special case of Euler's formula for planar graphs, as a tree will always be a planar graph with 1 face).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item{}First, prove a lemma (not using induction): every tree contains at least two vertices of degree 1.%
\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403347372112-back}{[Hint]}}\item{}We will give a proof by induction on the number of vertices in a tree.  What should the base case be?  Prove it.%

Start with an arbitrary tree \(T\) with \(n\) vertices and assume that \emph{all} trees with \(n-1\) vertices have \(n-2\) edges (why is the the right thing to assume)?

\space\hspace*{0pt}\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{g:hint:idp403347381152-back}{[Hint]}}\end{enumerate}

The proof we will give will be by induction on the number of edges of a graph.  This means we will need a way to reduce the number of edges, so we can get down to our inductive hypothesis.  There are two ways to remove an edge that will be useful here and for future problems.%
\par
\index{deletion} A \terminology{deletion} is the result of removing an edge from the edge set (everything else in the graph stays the same).  For a specific edge \(e\) in the graph \(G\), we write the new graph as \(G - e\).%
\par
\index{contraction} Slightly more complicated is a \terminology{contraction}.  The idea is we take an edge and shrink it down to a vertex.  The two endpoints of the vertex collide and all their incident edges follow along and become incident to this new vertex consisting of the edge and two vertices contracted together.  The resulting graph is written \(G/e\) (read ``\(G\) contract \(e\)'').%
\par
To be a little more precise, given a graph \(G\) and edge \(e = \{u,v\}\), the graph \(G/e\) is formed by%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}Removing vertices \(u\) and \(v\) and all their incident vertices.%
\item{}Adding a new vertex \(E\) and edges from \(E\) to each vertex that was previously adjacent to \(u\) or \(v\).%
\end{enumerate}
Notice that \(G/e\) might be a multigraph (if \(u\) and \(v\) were both adjacent to a common vertex).  If \(G\) was already a multigraph, and had two edges connecting \(u\) and \(v\), then \(E\) will get a loop (since only one of the edges was contracted).  We can avoid multigraphs by being careful which edge we contract along.%

For the complete graphs \(K_n\), we would like to be able to say something about the number of vertices, edges, and (if the graph is planar) faces.%

If you try to redraw this without edges crossing, you quickly get into trouble. There seems to be one edge too many. How could we prove this?%

\item{}We now have that for \(K_5\), the number of faces is \(f = 7\), and also \(3f \le 20\).  How is this possible?  What can we conclude?%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
Before proceeding, consider carefully the style of proof used here.  This is a \terminology{proof by contradiction}.  We assumed the opposite of what we wanted to show.  From that, we arrived at a contradiction, a statement that is necessarily false.  Is it valid to conclude that our original assumption is false?%
\par
Recall the truth table for an implication \(P \imp Q\):%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0.4}{0.4}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{0.2}%
{\centering%
\begin{tabular}{cAcBc}

F&T&T\tabularnewline[0pt]
F&F&T

\par}
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
In a proof by contradiction, we assume \(P\) (which will be the negation of our desired conclusion) and derive \(Q\), a contradiction.  That valid derivation allows us to conclude \(P \imp Q\) is \emph{true}!  But we know that \(Q\) is false.  What does that say about \(P\)?  If the implication is true and the consequent (``then'' part) is false, it must be that we are in row 4 of the truth table.  In that row, \(P\) is false.  So we are justified in concluding \(\neg P\).%
\par
In our case, \(P\) was the statement ``\(K_5\) is planar.''  So when we get a contradiction (a false \(Q\)), we can conclude that \(K_5\) is not planar.  Note that even though we are proving something about a graph that does not satisfy Euler's formula for planar graphs, by using a proof by contradiction, we get to \emph{use} the formula.%
\par
Here are a few more examples of this proof strategy, specifically to show graphs are not planar.%

\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
In general, if we let \(g\) be the size of the smallest cycle in a graph (\(g\) stands for \emph{girth}\index{girth}, which is the technical term for this) then for any planar graph we have \(gf \le 2e\). When this disagrees with Euler's formula, we know for sure that the graph cannot be planar.%

If a graph contains a non-planar subgraph, then the graph cannot itself be planar.  This gives us another method of proving a given graph is not planar: find a non-planar graph, perhaps \(K_5\) or \(K_{3,3}\) inside it.%
\par
From the other direction, you can think of starting with \(K_5\) or \(K_{3,3}\) and adding edges as well as adding vertices in the middle of edges (called \terminology{subdividing} the edge) to build a larger graph that is definitely not planar.  Surprisingly, \emph{every} non-planar graph arises this way, a result called \emph{Kuratowski's Theorem}.%

There are exactly four other regular polyhedra: the tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron with 4, 8, 12 and 20 faces respectively. How many vertices and edges do each of these have?%
\end{activity}
Another area of mathematics that uses the terms ``vertex,'' ``edge,'' and ``face'' is geometry. A \terminology{polyhedron}\index{polyhedron} is a geometric solid made up of flat polygonal faces joined at edges and vertices. We are especially interested in \terminology{convex}\index{convex} polyhedra, which means that any line segment connecting two points on the interior of the polyhedron must be entirely contained inside the polyhedron.\footnote{An alternative definition for convex is that the internal angle formed by any two faces must be less than \(180\deg\).\label{g:fn:idp403347524592}}%
\par
Notice that since \(8 - 12 + 6 = 2\), the vertices, edges and faces of a cube satisfy Euler's formula for planar graphs. This is not a coincidence. We can represent a cube as a planar graph by projecting the vertices and edges onto the plane. One such projection looks like this:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0.4}{0.4}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{0.2}%
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{%
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \foreach \ang in {45, 135, 225, 315} {
  \draw (\ang:.4) \v -- (\ang:1) \v -- (\ang+90:1) (\ang:.4) -- (\ang+90:.4);
  }
  \end{tikzpicture}
}%
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
In fact, \emph{every} convex polyhedron can be projected onto the plane without edges crossing. Think of placing the polyhedron inside a sphere, with a light at the center of the sphere. The edges and vertices of the polyhedron cast a shadow onto the interior of the sphere. You can then cut a hole in the sphere in the middle of one of the projected faces and ``stretch'' the sphere to lay down flat on the plane. The face that was punctured becomes the ``outside'' face of the planar graph.%
\par
The point is, we can apply what we know about graphs (in particular planar graphs) to convex polyhedra. Since every convex polyhedron can be represented as a planar graph, we see that Euler's formula for planar graphs holds for all convex polyhedra as well. We also can apply the same sort of reasoning we use for graphs in other contexts to convex polyhedra. For example, we know that there is no convex polyhedron with 11 vertices all of degree 3, as this would make 33\slash{}2 edges.%
\begin{example}{}{g:example:idp403347531824}%
Is there a convex polyhedron consisting of three triangles and six pentagons? What about three triangles, six pentagons and five heptagons (7-sided polygons)?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403347533024}{}\quad{}How many edges would such polyhedra have? For the first proposed polyhedron, the triangles would contribute a total of 9 edges, and the pentagons would contribute 30. However, this counts each edge twice (as each edge borders exactly two faces), giving 39\slash{}2 edges, an impossibility. There is no such polyhedron.%
\par
The second polyhedron does not have this obstacle. The extra 35 edges contributed by the heptagons give a total of 74\slash{}2 = 37 edges. So far so good. Now how many vertices does this supposed polyhedron have? We can use Euler's formula. There are 14 faces, so we have \(v - 37 + 14 = 2\) or equivalently \(v = 25\). But now use the vertices to count the edges again. Each vertex must have degree \emph{at least} three (that is, each vertex joins at least three faces since the interior angle of all the polygons must be less that \(180^\circ\)), so the sum of the degrees of vertices is at least 75. Since the sum of the degrees must be exactly twice the number of edges, this says that there are strictly more than 37 edges. Again, there is no such polyhedron.%

\item{}The traditional design of a soccer ball is in fact a (spherical projection of a) truncated icosahedron. This consists of 12 regular pentagons and 20 regular hexagons.

How many colors do you need to color the faces of a cube so that no two faces that share an edge are colored the same?  Is there a polyhedron that would require four colors to do this?  Is there a polyhedron that requires five?%
\end{investigation}
Perhaps the most famous graph theory problem is how to color maps.%
\begin{quote}%
Given any map of countries, states, counties, etc., how many colors are needed to color each region on the map so that neighboring regions are colored differently?%
\end{quote}
Actual map makers usually use around seven colors. For one thing, they require watery regions to be a specific color, and with a lot of colors it is easier to find a permissible coloring. We want to know whether there is a smaller palette that will work for any map.%
\par
How is this related to graph theory? Well, if we place a vertex in the center of each region (say in the capital of each state) and then connect two vertices if their states share a border, we get a graph. Coloring regions on the map corresponds to coloring the vertices of the graph. Since neighboring regions cannot be colored the same, our graph cannot have vertices colored the same when those vertices are adjacent.%
\par
In general, given any graph \(G\), a coloring of the vertices with \(k\) colors is called a \terminology{\(k\)-coloring}\index{vertex coloring}\index{\(k\)-coloring}. If the coloring has the property that adjacent vertices are colored differently, then the coloring is called \terminology{proper}. Every graph has a proper \(k\)-coloring for some \(k\). For example, you could color every vertex with a different color. But often you can do better. The smallest \(k\) for which there is a proper \(k\)-coloring is called the \terminology{chromatic number}\index{chromatic number} of the graph, written \(\chi(G)\)\label{g:notation:idp403347619088}.%

\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{g:solution:idp403347625440}{}\quad{}The graph on the left is \(K_6\). The only way to properly color the graph is to give every vertex a different color (since every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex). Thus the chromatic number is 6.%
\par
The middle graph can be properly colored with just 3 colors (Red, Blue, and Green). For example:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0.375}{0.375}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{0.25}%
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{%

	    \end{tikzpicture}
}%
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
There is no way to color it with just two colors, since there are three vertices mutually adjacent (i.e., a triangle). Thus the chromatic number is 3.%
\par
The graph on the right is just \(K_{2,3}\). As with all bipartite graphs, this graph has chromatic number 2: color the vertices on the top row red and the vertices on the bottom row blue.%
\end{example}
It appears that there is no limit to how large chromatic numbers can get; the graph \(K_n\) has chromatic number \(n\). So how could there possibly be an answer to the original map coloring question? If the chromatic number of graph can be arbitrarily large, then it seems like there would be no upper bound to the number of colors needed for any map. But there is.%
\par
The key observation is that while it is true that for any number \(n\), there is a graph with chromatic number \(n\), only some graphs arrive as representations of maps. If you convert a map to a graph, the edges between vertices correspond to borders between the countries. So you should be able to connect vertices in such a way where the edges do not cross. In other words, the graphs representing maps are all \emph{planar}!%
\par
So the question is, what is the largest chromatic number of any planar graph? The answer is the infamous Four Color Theorem.%
\begin{theorem}{The Four Color Theorem.}{}{g:theorem:idp403347634800}%
\index{Four Color Theorem} If \(G\) is a planar graph, then the chromatic number of \(G\) is less than or equal to 4. Thus any map can be properly colored with 4 or fewer colors.%
\end{theorem}
We will not prove this theorem. Really. Even though the theorem is easy to state and understand, the proof is not. In fact, there is currently no ``easy'' known proof of the theorem. The current best proof still requires powerful computers to check an \emph{unavoidable set} of 633 \emph{reducible configurations}. The idea is that every graph must contain one of these reducible configurations (this fact also needs to be checked by a computer) and that reducible configurations can, in fact, be colored in 4 or fewer colors.%
\par
Of course if every planar graph has chromatic number at most 4, then every graph has chromatic number no more than 6.  Proving this (even without using the 4 color theorem) is not very difficult, and this at least shows that the chromatic numbers for planar graphs is bounded.%

In 1879, Alfred Kempe published a proof of the Four Color Theorem.  It wasn't until 11 years later that Percy John Heawood found an error in the proof.  However, the failed proof did lead to a nice proof that every planar graph has chromatic number at most five.  The next activity walks you through that proof.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403347651568}%
We will prove the Five Color Theorem, that every planar graph has a proper vertex coloring using five (or fewer) colors.  We proceed by induction on the number of vertices.  So assume that \(G\) is a planar graph with \(n\) vertices, and all planar graphs with fewer vertices have a proper 5-coloring.  We will use \(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\) as our set of colors.%

You will notice that the proof above doesn't ever use \(v_5\), so it is tempting to apply this same technique to prove the four color theorem.  See if you can find the error in doing so in fewer than 11 years.%

In the example above, the chromatic number was 5, but this is not a counterexample to the Four Color Theorem, since the graph representing the radio stations is not planar. It would be nice to have some quick way to find the chromatic number of a (possibly non-planar) graph. It turns out nobody knows whether an efficient algorithm for computing chromatic numbers exists.%
\par
While we might not be able to find the exact chromatic number of graph easily, we can often give a reasonable range for the chromatic number. In other words, we can give upper and lower bounds for chromatic number.%
\par
This is actually not very difficult: for every graph \(G\), the chromatic number of \(G\) is at least 1 and at most the number of vertices of \(G\).%

Graphs that do not contain \(K_3\) are called \terminology{triangle-free}.

This proves that the there are graphs without even \(K_3\) that have arbitrarily high chromatic number, so the difference between the clique number and chromatic number can be arbitrarily large.%
\par
There are times when the chromatic number of \(G\) is \emph{equal} to the clique number. These graphs have a special name; they are called \terminology{perfect}\index{perfect graph} (actually for a graph to be perfect, every induced subgraph must have this property). If you know that a graph is perfect, then finding the chromatic number is simply a matter of searching for the largest clique.\footnote{There are special classes of graphs which can be proved to be perfect.  One such class is the set of \terminology{chordal} graphs, which have the property that every cycle in the graph contains a \terminology{chord}\textemdash{}an edge between two vertices of the cycle which are not adjacent in the cycle.\label{g:fn:idp403347755008}} However, not all graphs are perfect, and searching for the largest clique isn't always easy anyway.%
\par
What about an upper bound?  For planar graphs, \(\chi(G) \le 4\).  Also, if a graph has a proper \(k\)-coloring, then \(\chi(G) \le k\), but this requires attempting a coloring first.  Can we do better? It is helpful to recall our attempts to prove the 6- and 5-color theorems.%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403347758800}%
Let \(G\) be any graph and let \(v\) be a vertex with degree \(k\).  Let \(H = G - v\) be the subgraph resulting from removing \(v\) and all its incident edges.%

Some notation will come in handy.  For a vertex \(v\), write \(d(v)\) for the degree of \(v\) (i.e., the number of vertices incident to it).  We write \(\Delta(G)\) for the \terminology{maximum degree of \(G\)}, which is \(\Delta(G) = \max\{d(v) \st v \in G\}\).%
\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403347768128}%

There are graphs for which \(\chi(G) = \Delta(G) + 1\).  For example, \(G\) might be an odd cycle, which has \(\Delta(G) = 2\) but \(\chi(G) = 3\).  Also note that \(\Delta(K_n) = n-1\) but \(\chi(K_n) = n\).%
\par
Surprisingly, for connected graphs, these are the only examples of this.%

The proof of this theorem is a little tricky.  We will be content with the following special case.%

\begin{subsectionptx}{Coloring Edges}{}{Coloring Edges}{}{}{g:subsection:idp403347796640}
The chromatic number of a graph tells us about coloring vertices, but we could also ask about coloring edges. Just like with vertex coloring, we might insist that edges that are adjacent must be colored differently. Here, we are thinking of two edges as being adjacent if they are incident to the same vertex. The least number of colors required to properly color the edges of a graph \(G\) is called the \terminology{chromatic index}\index{chromatic index} of \(G\), written \(\chi'(G)\)\label{g:notation:idp403347799952}.%

Six friends decide to spend the afternoon playing chess. Everyone will play everyone else once. They have plenty of chess sets but nobody wants to play more than one game at a time. Games will last an hour (thanks to their handy chess clocks). How many hours will the tournament last?%
\end{activity}
Interestingly, if one of the friends in the above example left, the remaining 5 chess-letes would still need 5 hours: the chromatic index of \(K_5\) is also 5.%
\par
In general, what can we say about chromatic index? Certainly \(\chi'(G) \ge \Delta(G)\). But how much higher could it be? Only a little higher.%
\begin{theorem}{Vizing's Theorem.}{}{g:theorem:idp403347809440}%
\index{Vizing's Theorem} For any graph \(G\), the chromatic index \(\chi'(G)\) is either \(\Delta(G)\) or \(\Delta(G) + 1\).%
\end{theorem}
At first this theorem makes it seem like chromatic index might not be very interesting. However, deciding which case a graph is in is not always easy. Graphs for which \(\chi'(G) = \Delta(G)\) are called \emph{class 1}, while the others are called \emph{class 2}. Bipartite graphs always satisfy \(\chi'(G) = \Delta(G)\), so are class 1 (this was proved by König in 1916, decades before Vizing proved his theorem in 1964). In 1965 Vizing proved that all planar graphs with \(\Delta(G) \ge 8\) are of class 1, but this does not hold for all planar graphs with \(2 \le \Delta(G) \le 5\). Vizing conjectured that all planar graphs with \(\Delta(G) = 6\) or \(\Delta(G) = 7\) are class 1; the \(\Delta(G) = 7\) case was proved in 2001 by Sanders and Zhao; the \(\Delta(G) = 6\) case is still open.%

There is another interesting way we might consider coloring edges, quite different from what we have discussed so far. What if we colored every edge of a graph either red or blue. Can we do so without, say, creating a \emph{monochromatic}\index{monochromatic} triangle (i.e., an all red or all blue triangle)? Certainly for some graphs the answer is yes.%

\end{activity}
More generally, we can ask for the smallest number \(R = R(m,n)\) such that no matter how we color the edges of \(K_R\) using red and blue, there will either be a red copy of \(K_m\) or a blue copy of \(K_n\).

We can also color the edges with more colors.  For example, \(R(3,3,3) = 17\), which says that if you color the edges of \(K_{17}\) red, blue and green, there is guaranteed to be a monochromatic triangle in one of these colors.%

In any \terminology{matching} is a subset \(M\) of the edges for which no two edges of \(M\) are incident to a common vertex.  If every vertex belongs to exactly one of the edges, we say the matching is \terminology{perfect}. Our goal is to discover some criterion for when a bipartite graph has a prefect matching.%
\par
\index{matching} Suppose you have a bipartite graph \(G\). This will consist of two sets of vertices \(A\) and \(B\) with some edges connecting some vertices of \(A\) to some vertices in \(B\) (but of course, no edges between two vertices both in \(A\) or both in \(B\)). A \terminology{matching} of \(G\) is a set of \terminology{independent edges}, meaning no two edges in the set are adjacent.  If every vertex in \(G\) is incident to exactly one edge in the matching, we call the matching \terminology{perfect}. If a bipartite graph has a perfect matching, then \(\card{A} = \card{B}\), but in general, we could have a \terminology{matching of \(A\)}, which will mean that every vertex in \(A\) is incident to an edge in the matching.%
\par
Some context might make this easier to understand. Think of the vertices in \(A\) as representing students in a class, and the vertices in \(B\) as representing presentation topics. We put an edge from a vertex \(a \in A\) to a vertex \(b \in B\) if student \(a\) would like to present on topic \(b\). Of course, some students would want to present on more than one topic, so their vertex would have degree greater than 1. As the teacher, you want to assign each student their own unique topic. Thus you want to find a matching of \(A\): you pick some subset of the edges so that each student gets matched up with exactly one topic, and no topic gets matched to two students.\footnote{The standard example for matchings used to be the \emph{marriage problem} in which \(A\) consisted of the men in the town, \(B\) the women, and an edge represented a marriage that was agreeable to both parties.  A matching then represented a way for the town elders to marry off everyone in the town, no polygamy allowed.\label{g:fn:idp403347893696}}%

The question is: when does a bipartite graph contain a matching of \(A\)? To begin to answer this question, consider what could prevent the graph from containing a matching. This will not necessarily tell us a condition when the graph \emph{does} have a matching, but at least it is a start.%

One way \(G\) could not have a matching is if there is a vertex in \(A\) not adjacent to any vertex in \(B\) (so having degree 0). What else? What if two students both like the same one topic, and no others? Then after assigning that one topic to the first student, there is nothing left for the second student to like, so it is very much as if the second student has degree 0. Or what if three students like only two topics between them. Again, after assigning one student a topic, we reduce this down to the previous case of two students liking only one topic. We can continue this way with more and more students. %
\par
It should be clear at this point that if there is every a group of \(n\) students who as a group like \(n-1\) or fewer topics, then no matching is possible. This is true for any value of \(n\), and any group of \(n\) students.%
\par
To make this more graph-theoretic, say you have a set \(S \subseteq A\) of vertices. Define \(N(S)\)\label{g:notation:idp403347922128} to be the set of all the \terminology{neighbors}\index{neighbors} of vertices in \(S\). That is, \(N(S)\) contains all the vertices (in \(B\)) which are adjacent to at least one of the vertices in \(S\). (In the student\slash{}topic graph, \(N(S)\) is the set of topics liked by the students of \(S\).) Our discussion above can be summarized as follows:%
\begin{lemma}{Matching Condition.}{}{g:lemma:idp403347927152}%
\index{matching condition} If a bipartite graph \(G = \{A, B\}\) has a matching of \(A\), then%

\begin{activity}{}{g:activity:idp403347930640}%

Is the converse true? Suppose \(G\) satisfies the matching condition \(|N(S)| \ge |S|\) for all \(S \subseteq A\) (every set of vertices has at least as many neighbors than vertices in the set). Does that mean that there is a matching? Surprisingly, yes. The obvious necessary condition is also sufficient.\footnote{This happens often in graph theory.  If you can avoid the obvious counterexamples, you often get what you want.\label{g:fn:idp403347933680}} This is a theorem first proved by Philip Hall in 1935.\footnote{There is also an infinite version of the theorem which was proved by the unrelated Marshal Hall, Jr.\label{g:fn:idp403347934256}}%

One way you might check to see whether a partial matching is maximal is to construct an \terminology{alternating path}. This is a path whose adjacent edges alternate between edges in the matching and edges not in the matching (no edge can be used more than once, since this is a path). If an alternating path starts and stops with vertices that are \emph{not} matched, (that is, these vertices are not incident to any edge in the matching) then the path is called an \terminology{augmenting path}.%

If a graph does not have a perfect matching, then any of its maximal matchings must leave a vertex unmatched.  In particular, there cannot be an augmenting path starting at such a vertex (otherwise the maximal matching would not be maximal).

While walking through a fictional forest, you encounter three trolls guarding a bridge. Each is either a \emph{knight}, who always tells the truth, or a \emph{knave}, who always lies. The trolls will not let you pass until you correctly identify each as either a knight or a knave. Each troll makes a single statement:%
\begin{quote}%
Troll 1: If I am a knave, then there are exactly two knights here.%
\par
Troll 2: Troll 1 is lying.%
\par
Troll 3: Either we are all knaves or at least one of us is a knight.%

In order to \emph{do} mathematics, we must be able to \emph{talk} and \emph{write} about mathematics. Perhaps your experience with mathematics so far has mostly involved finding answers to problems. As we embark towards more advanced and abstract mathematics, writing will play a more prominent role in the mathematical process.%
\par
Communication in mathematics requires more precision than many other subjects, and thus we should take a few pages here to consider the basic building blocks: \emph{mathematical statements}.%

\begin{subsectionptx}{Atomic and Molecular Statements}{}{Atomic and Molecular Statements}{}{}{x:subsection:atomic-molecular-statements}
A \terminology{statement} \index{statement} is any declarative sentence which is either true or false. A statement is \terminology{atomic} if it cannot be divided into smaller statements, otherwise it is called \terminology{molecular}.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:yzz}%
These are statements (in fact, \emph{atomic} statements):%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits.%
\item{}The moon is made of cheese.%
\item{}42 is a perfect square.%
\item{}Every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.%
\item{}\(3+7 = 12\)%
\end{itemize}
And these are not statements:%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}Would you like some cake?%
\item{}The sum of two squares.%
\item{}\(1+3+5+7+\cdots+2n+1\).%
\item{}Go to your room!%
\item{}\(3+x = 12\)%
\end{itemize}
%
\end{example}
The reason the sentence ``\(3 + x = 12\)'' is not a statement is that it contains a variable. Depending on what \(x\) is, the sentence is either true or false, but right now it is neither. One way to make the \emph{sentence} into a \emph{statement} is to specify the value of the variable in some way. This could be done by specifying a specific substitution, for example, ``\(3+x = 12\) where \(x = 9\),'' which is a true statement. Or you could \emph{capture} the free variable by \emph{quantifying} over it, as in, ``for all values of \(x\), \(3+x = 12\),'' which is false. We will discuss quantifiers in more detail at the end of this section.%
\par
You can build more complicated (molecular) statements out of simpler (atomic or molecular) ones using \terminology{logical connectives}. \index{connectives} For example, this is a molecular statement:%
\begin{quote}%
Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits and 42 is a perfect square.%
\end{quote}
Note that we can break this down into two smaller statements. The two shorter statements are \emph{connected} by an ``and.'' We will consider 5 connectives: ``and'' (Sam is a man and Chris is a woman), ``or'' (Sam is a man or Chris is a woman), ``if\textellipsis{}, then\textellipsis{}'' (if Sam is a man, then Chris is a woman), ``if and only if'' (Sam is a man if and only if Chris is a woman), and ``not'' (Sam is not a man). The first four are called \terminology{binary connectives} (because they connect two statements) while ``not'' is an example of a \terminology{unary connective} (since it applies to a single statement).%
\par
These molecular statements are of course still statements, so they must be either true or false. The absolutely key observation here is that which \terminology{truth value} \index{truth value} the molecular statement achieves is completely determined by the type of connective and the truth values of the parts. We do not need to know what the parts actually say, only whether those parts are true or false. So to analyze logical connectives, it is enough to consider \terminology{propositional variables} (sometimes called \emph{sentential} variables), usually capital letters in the middle of the alphabet: \(P, Q, R, S, \ldots\). We think of these as standing in for (usually atomic) statements, but there are only two \emph{values} the variables can achieve: true or false.\footnote{In computer programing, we should call such variables \terminology{Boolean variables}.\label{g:fn:idp403348274720}}\label{g:notation:idp403348275504} We also have symbols for the logical connectives: \(\wedge\), \(\vee\), \(\imp\), \(\iff\), \(\neg\).%
\begin{assemblage}{Logical Connectives.}{p:assemblage:pfN}%
%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\(P \wedge Q\) is read ``\(P\) and \(Q\),'' and called a \terminology{conjunction}. \index{conjunction} \index{connectives!and} \label{g:notation:idp403348284992}%
\item{}\(P \vee Q\) is read ``\(P\) or \(Q\),'' and called a \terminology{disjunction}. \index{disjunction} \index{connectives!or} \label{g:notation:idp403348290512}%

\end{itemize}
%
\end{assemblage}
The \terminology{truth value} of a statement is determined by the truth value(s) of its part(s), depending on the connectives:%
\begin{assemblage}{Truth Conditions for Connectives.}{p:assemblage:VmW}%
%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\(P \wedge Q\) is true when both \(P\) and \(Q\) are true%
\item{}\(P \vee Q\) is true when \(P\) or \(Q\) or both are true.%
\item{}\(P \imp Q\) is true when \(P\) is false or \(Q\) is true or both.%
\item{}\(P \iff Q\) is true when \(P\) and \(Q\) are both true, or both false.%
\item{}\(\neg P\) is true when \(P\) is false.%
\end{itemize}
%
\end{assemblage}
Note that for us, \emph{or} is the \terminology{inclusive or} \index{inclusive or} (and not the sometimes used \emph{exclusive or}) meaning that \(P \vee Q\) is in fact true when both \(P\) and \(Q\) are true. As for the other connectives, ``and'' behaves as you would expect, as does negation. The biconditional (if and only if) might seem a little strange, but you should think of this as saying the two parts of the statements are \emph{equivalent} in that they have the same truth value. This leaves only the conditional \(P \imp Q\) which has a slightly different meaning in mathematics than it does in ordinary usage. However, implications are so common and useful in mathematics, that we must develop fluency with their use, and as such, they deserve their own subsection.%

\begin{subsectionptx}{Implications}{}{Implications}{}{}{x:subsection:subsec_implications}
\begin{assemblage}{Implications.}{p:assemblage:Buf}%
An \terminology{implication} or \terminology{conditional} is a molecular statement of the form%
\begin{equation*}
P \imp Q
\end{equation*}
where \(P\) and \(Q\) are statements. We say that%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\(P\) is the \terminology{hypothesis} (or \terminology{antecedent}).%
\item{}\(Q\) is the \terminology{conclusion} (or \terminology{consequent}).%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
An implication is \emph{true} provided \(P\) is false or \(Q\) is true (or both), and \emph{false} otherwise. In particular, the only way for \(P \imp Q\) to be false is for \(P\) to be true \emph{and} \(Q\) to be false.%
\end{assemblage}
Easily the most common type of statement in mathematics is the implication. Even statements that do not at first look like they have this form conceal an implication at their heart. Consider the \emph{Pythagorean Theorem}. Many a college freshman would quote this theorem as ``\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).'' This is absolutely not correct. For one thing, that is not a statement since it has three variables in it. Perhaps they imply that this should be true for any values of the variables? So \(1^2 + 5^2 = 2^2\)??? How can we fix this? Well, the equation is true as long as \(a\) and \(b\) are the legs or a right triangle and \(c\) is the hypotenuse. In other words:%
\begin{quote}%
\emph{If} \(a\) and \(b\) are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse \(c\), \emph{then} \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).%
\end{quote}
This is a reasonable way to think about implications: our claim is that the conclusion (``then'' part) is true, but on the assumption that the hypothesis (``if'' part) is true. We make no claim about the conclusion in situations when the hypothesis is false.\footnote{However, note that in the case of the Pythagorean Theorem, it is also the case that \emph{if} \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\), \emph{then} \(a\) and \(b\) are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse \(c\). So we could have also expressed this theorem as a biconditional: ``\(a\) and \(b\) are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse \(c\) \emph{if and only if} \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).''\label{g:fn:idp403348350928}}%
\par
Still, it is important to remember that an implication is a statement, and therefore is either true or false. The truth value of the implication is determined by the truth values of its two parts. To agree with the usage above, we say that an implication is true either when the hypothesis is false, or when the conclusion is true. This leaves only one way for an implication to be false: when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:eGI}%
Consider the statement:%
\begin{quote}%
If Bob gets a 90 on the final, then Bob will pass the class.%
\end{quote}
This is definitely an implication: \(P\) is the statement ``Bob gets a 90 on the final,'' and \(Q\) is the statement ``Bob will pass the class.''%
\par
Suppose I made that statement to Bob. In what circumstances would it be fair to call me a liar? What if Bob really did get a 90 on the final, and he did pass the class? Then I have not lied; my statement is true. However, if Bob did get a 90 on the final and did not pass the class, then I lied, making the statement false. The tricky case is this: what if Bob did not get a 90 on the final? Maybe he passes the class, maybe he doesn't. Did I lie in either case? I think not. In these last two cases, \(P\) was false, and the statement \(P \imp Q\) was true. In the first case, \(Q\) was true, and so was \(P \imp Q\). So \(P \imp Q\) is true when either \(P\) is false or \(Q\) is true.%
\end{example}
Just to be clear, although we sometimes read \(P \imp Q\) as ``\(P\) \emph{implies} \(Q\)'', we are not insisting that there is some causal relationship between the statements \(P\) and \(Q\). In particular, if you claim that \(P \imp Q\) is \emph{false}, you are not saying that \(P\) does not imply \(Q\), but rather that \(P\) is true and \(Q\) is false.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:KNR}%
Decide which of the following statements are true and which are false. Briefly explain.%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}If \(1=1\), then most horses have 4 legs.%
\item{}If \(0=1\), then \(1=1\).%
\item{}If 8 is a prime number, then the 7624th digit of \(\pi\) is an 8.%
\item{}If the 7624th digit of \(\pi\) is an 8, then \(2+2 = 4\).%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:AoM}{}\quad{}All four of the statements are true. Remember, the only way for an implication to be false is for the \emph{if} part to be true and the \emph{then} part to be false.%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}Here both the hypothesis and the conclusion are true, so the implication is true. It does not matter that there is no meaningful connection between the true mathematical fact and the fact about horses.%
\item{}Here the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is true, so the implication is true.%
\item{}I have no idea what the 7624th digit of \(\pi\) is, but this does not matter. Since the hypothesis is false, the implication is automatically true.%
\item{}Similarly here, regardless of the truth value of the hypothesis, the conclusion is true, making the implication true.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{example}
It is important to understand the conditions under which an implication is true not only to decide whether a mathematical statement is true, but in order to \emph{prove} that it is. Proofs might seem scary (especially if you have had a bad high school geometry experience) but all we are really doing is explaining (very carefully) why a statement is true. If you understand the truth conditions for an implication, you already have the outline for a proof.%
\begin{assemblage}{Direct Proofs of Implications.}{p:assemblage:hBo}%
To prove an implication \(P \imp Q\), it is enough to assume \(P\), and from it, deduce \(Q\).%
\end{assemblage}
Perhaps a better way to say this is that to prove a statement of the form \(P \imp Q\) directly, you must explain why \(Q\) is true, but you \emph{get to} assume \(P\) is true first. After all, you only care about whether \(Q\) is true in the case that \(P\) is as well.%
\par
There are other techniques to prove statements (implications and others) that we will encounter throughout our studies, and new proof techniques are discovered all the time. Direct proof is the easiest and most elegant style of proof and has the advantage that such a proof often does a great job of explaining \emph{why} the statement is true.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:qVa}%
Prove: If two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) are even, then their sum \(a+b\) is even.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:gvV}{}\quad{}\begin{proofptx}{}{p:proof:MDe}
Suppose the numbers \(a\) and \(b\) are even. This means that \(a = 2k\) and \(b=2j\) for some integers \(k\) and \(j\). The sum is then \(a+b = 2k+2j = 2(k+j)\). Since \(k+j\) is an integer, this means that \(a+b\) is even.%
\end{proofptx}
Notice that since we get to assume the hypothesis of the implication, we immediately have a place to start. The proof proceeds essentially by repeatedly asking and answering, ``what does that mean?'' Eventually, we conclude that it means the conclusion.%
\end{example}
This sort of argument shows up outside of math as well. If you ever found yourself starting an argument with ``hypothetically, let's assume \textellipsis{},'' then you have attempted a direct proof of your desired conclusion.%
\par
An implication is a way of expressing a relationship between two statements. It is often interesting to ask whether there are other relationships between the statements. Here we introduce some common language to address this question.%
\begin{assemblage}{Converse and Contrapositive.}{p:assemblage:NIx}%
%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}The \terminology{converse} \index{converse} of an implication \(P \imp Q\) is the implication \(Q \imp P\). The converse is NOT logically equivalent to the original implication. That is, whether the converse of an implication is true is independent of the truth of the implication.%
\item{}The \terminology{contrapositive} \index{contrapositive} of an implication \(P \imp Q\) is the statement \(\neg Q \imp \neg P\). An implication and its contrapositive are logically equivalent (they are either both true or both false).%
\end{itemize}
%
\end{assemblage}
Mathematics is overflowing with examples of true implications which have a false converse. If a number greater than 2 is prime, then that number is odd. However, just because a number is odd does not mean it is prime. If a shape is a square, then it is a rectangle. But it is false that if a shape is a rectangle, then it is a square.%
\par
However, sometimes the converse of a true statement is also true. For example, the Pythagorean theorem has a true converse: if\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\), then the triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is a \emph{right} triangle. Whenever you encounter an implication in mathematics, it is always reasonable to ask whether the converse is true.%
\par
The contrapositive, on the other hand, always has the same truth value as its original implication. This can be very helpful in deciding whether an implication is true: often it is easier to analyze the contrapositive.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:Xcj}%
True or false: If you draw any nine playing cards from a regular deck, then you will have at least three cards all of the same suit. Is the converse true?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:sKn}{}\quad{}True. The original implication is a little hard to analyze because there are so many different combinations of nine cards. But consider the contrapositive: If you \emph{don't} have at least three cards all of the same suit, then you don't have nine cards. It is easy to see why this is true: you can at most have two cards of each of the four suits, for a total of eight cards (or fewer).%
\par
The converse: If you have at least three cards all of the same suit, then you have nine cards. This is false. You could have three spades and nothing else. Note that to demonstrate that the converse (an implication) is false, we provided an example where the hypothesis is true (you do have three cards of the same suit), but where the conclusion is false (you do not have nine cards).%
\end{example}
Understanding converses and contrapositives can help understand implications and their truth values:%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:Djs}%
Suppose I tell Sue that if she gets a 93\% on her final, then she will get an A in the class. Assuming that what I said is true, what can you conclude in the following cases:%
\par
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}Sue gets a 93\% on her final.%
\item{}Sue gets an A in the class.%
\item{}Sue does not get a 93\% on her final.%
\item{}Sue does not get an A in the class.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:YRw}{}\quad{}Note first that whenever \(P \imp Q\) and \(P\) are both true statements, \(Q\) must be true as well. For this problem, take \(P\) to mean ``Sue gets a 93\% on her final'' and \(Q\) to mean ``Sue will get an A in the class.''%
\par
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}We have \(P \imp Q\) and \(P\), so \(Q\) follows. Sue gets an A.%
\item{}You cannot conclude anything. Sue could have gotten the A because she did extra credit for example. Notice that we do not know that if Sue gets an \(A\), then she gets a 93\% on her final. That is the converse of the original implication, so it might or might not be true.%
\item{}The contrapositive of the converse of \(P \imp Q\) is \(\neg P \imp \neg Q\), which states that if Sue does not get a 93\% on the final, then she will not get an A in the class. But this does not follow from the original implication. Again, we can conclude nothing. Sue could have done extra credit.%
\item{}What would happen if Sue does not get an A but \emph{did} get a 93\% on the final? Then \(P\) would be true and \(Q\) would be false. This makes the implication \(P \imp Q\) false! It must be that Sue did not get a 93\% on the final. Notice now we have the implication \(\neg Q \imp \neg P\) which is the contrapositive of \(P \imp Q\). Since \(P \imp Q\) is assumed to be true, we know \(\neg Q \imp \neg P\) is true as well.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{example}
As we said above, an implication is not logically equivalent to its converse, but it is possible that both the implication and its converse are true. In this case, when both \(P \imp Q\) and \(Q \imp P\) are true, we say that \(P\) and \(Q\) are equivalent and write \(P \iff Q\). This is the biconditional we mentioned earlier.%
\begin{assemblage}{If and only if.}{p:assemblage:tPG}%
\begin{quote}%
\(P \iff Q\) is logically equivalent to \((P \imp Q) \wedge (Q \imp P)\).%
\end{quote}
Example: Given an integer \(n\), it is true that \(n\) is even if and only if \(n^2\) is even. That is, if \(n\) is even, then \(n^2\) is even, as well as the converse: if \(n^2\) is even, then \(n\) is even.%
\end{assemblage}
You can think of ``if and only if'' statements as having two parts: an implication and its converse. We might say one is the ``if'' part, and the other is the ``only if'' part. We also sometimes say that ``if and only if'' statements have two directions: a forward direction \((P \imp Q)\) and a backwards direction (\(P \leftarrow Q\), which is really just sloppy notation for \(Q \imp P\)).%
\par
Let's think a little about which part is which. Is \(P \imp Q\) the ``if'' part or the ``only if'' part? Consider an example.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:jqB}%
Suppose it is true that I sing if and only if I'm in the shower. We know this means both that if I sing, then I'm in the shower, and also the converse, that if I'm in the shower, then I sing. Let \(P\) be the statement, ``I sing,'' and \(Q\) be, ``I'm in the shower.'' So \(P \imp Q\) is the statement ``if I sing, then I'm in the shower.'' Which part of the if and only if statement is this?%
\par
What we are really asking for is the meaning of ``I sing \emph{if} I'm in the shower'' and ``I sing \emph{only if} I'm in the shower.'' When is the first one (the ``if'' part) \emph{false}? When I am in the shower but not singing. That is the same condition on being false as the statement ``if I'm in the shower, then I sing.'' So the ``if'' part is \(Q \imp P\). On the other hand, to say, ``I sing only if I'm in the shower'' is equivalent to saying ``if I sing, then I'm in the shower,'' so the ``only if'' part is \(P \imp Q\).%
\end{example}
It is not terribly important to know which part is the ``if'' or ``only if'' part, but this does illustrate something very, very important: \emph{there are many ways to state an implication!}%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:PxK}%
Rephrase the implication, ``if I dream, then I am asleep'' in as many different ways as possible. Then do the same for the converse.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:EYF}{}\quad{}The following are all equivalent to the original implication:%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}I am asleep if I dream.%
\item{}I dream only if I am asleep.%
\item{}In order to dream, I must be asleep.%
\item{}To dream, it is necessary that I am asleep.%
\item{}To be asleep, it is sufficient to dream.%
\item{}I am not dreaming unless I am asleep.%
\end{enumerate}
The following are equivalent to the converse (if I am asleep, then I dream):%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}I dream if I am asleep.%
\item{}I am asleep only if I dream.%
\item{}It is necessary that I dream in order to be asleep.%
\item{}It is sufficient that I be asleep in order to dream.%
\item{}If I don't dream, then I'm not asleep.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{example}
Hopefully you agree with the above example. We include the ``necessary and sufficient'' versions because those are common when discussing mathematics. In fact, let's agree once and for all what they mean.%
\begin{assemblage}{Necessary and Sufficient.}{p:assemblage:ZWP}%
%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}``\(P\) is necessary for \(Q\)'' means \(Q \imp P\).%
\item{}``\(P\) is sufficient for \(Q\)'' means \(P \imp Q\).%
\item{}If \(P\) is necessary and sufficient for \(Q\), then \(P \iff Q\).%
\end{itemize}
%
\end{assemblage}
To be honest, I have trouble with these if I'm not very careful. I find it helps to keep a standard example for reference.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:vET}%
Recall from calculus, if a function is differentiable at a point \(c\), then it is continuous at \(c\), but that the converse of this statement is not true (for example, \(f(x) = |x|\) at the point 0). Restate this fact using ``necessary and sufficient'' language.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:lfO}{}\quad{}It is true that in order for a function to be differentiable at a point \(c\), it is necessary for the function to be continuous at \(c\). However, it is not necessary that a function be differentiable at \(c\) for it to be continuous at \(c\).%
\par
It is true that to be continuous at a point \(c\), it is sufficient that the function be differentiable at \(c\). However, it is not the case that being continuous at \(c\) is sufficient for a function to be differentiable at \(c\).%
\end{example}
Thinking about the necessity and sufficiency of conditions can also help when writing proofs and justifying conclusions. If you want to establish some mathematical fact, it is helpful to think what other facts would \emph{be enough} (be sufficient) to prove your fact. If you have an assumption, think about what must also be necessary if that hypothesis is true.%

\index{free variable} \index{predicate} It would be nice to use variables in our mathematical sentences. For example, suppose we wanted to claim that if \(n\) is prime, then \(n+7\) is not prime. This looks like an implication. I would like to write something like%
\begin{equation*}
P(n) \imp \neg P(n+7)
\end{equation*}
where \(P(n)\) means ``\(n\) is prime.'' But this is not quite right. For one thing, because this sentence has a \terminology{free variable} (that is, a variable that we have not specified anything about), it is not a statement.  A sentence that contains variables is called a \terminology{predicate}.%
\par
Now, if we plug in a specific value for \(n\), we do get a statement. In fact, it turns out that no matter what value we plug in for \(n\), we get a true implication in this case. What we really want to say is that \emph{for all} values of \(n\), if \(n\) is prime, then \(n+7\) is not. We need to \emph{quantify} the variable.%
\par
Although there are many types of \emph{quantifiers} in English (e.g., many, few, most, etc.) in mathematics we, for the most part, stick to two: existential and universal.%
\begin{assemblage}{Universal and Existential Quantifiers.}{p:assemblage:mlh}%
The existential quantifier is \(\exists\) and is read ``there exists'' or ``there is.'' For example, \index{existential quantifier} \index{quantifiers!exists} \label{g:notation:idp403342653488}%
\begin{equation*}
\exists x (x \lt 0)
\end{equation*}
asserts that there is a number less than 0.%
\par
The universal quantifier is \(\forall\) and is read ``for all'' or ``every.'' For example, \index{universal quantifier} \index{quantifiers!for all} \label{g:notation:idp403348538512}%
\begin{equation*}
\forall x (x \ge 0)
\end{equation*}
asserts that every number is greater than or equal to 0.%
\end{assemblage}
As with all mathematical statements, we would like to decide whether quantified statements are true or false. Consider the statement%
\begin{equation*}
\forall x \exists y (y \lt x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
You would read this, ``for every \(x\) there is some \(y\) such that \(y\) is less than \(x\).'' Is this true? The answer depends on what our \emph{domain of discourse} is: when we say ``for all'' \(x\), do we mean all positive integers or all real numbers or all elements of some other set? Usually this information is implied. In discrete mathematics, we almost always quantify over the \emph{natural numbers}, 0, 1, 2, \textellipsis{}, so let's take that for our domain of discourse here.%
\par
For the statement to be true, we need it to be the case that no matter what natural number we select, there is always some natural number that is strictly smaller. Perhaps we could let \(y\) be \(x-1\)? But here is the problem: what if \(x = 0\)? Then \(y = -1\) and that is \emph{not a number!} (in our domain of discourse). Thus we see that the statement is false because there is a number which is less than or equal to all other numbers. In symbols,%
\begin{equation*}
\exists x \forall y (y \ge x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
To show that the original statement is false, we proved that the \emph{negation} was true. Notice how the negation and original statement compare. This is typical.%
\begin{assemblage}{Quantifiers and Negation.}{p:assemblage:Ssq}%
\begin{quote}%
\(\neg \forall x P(x)\) is equivalent to \(\exists x \neg P(x)\).%
\par
\(\neg \exists x P(x)\) is equivalent to \(\forall x \neg P(x)\).%
\end{quote}
\end{assemblage}
Essentially, we can pass the negation symbol over a quantifier, but that causes the quantifier to switch type. This should not be surprising: if not everything has a property, then something doesn't have that property. And if there is not something with a property, then everything doesn't have that property.%
\begin{paragraphs}{Implicit Quantifiers.}{x:paragraphs:pars-implicituantifiers}%
It is always a good idea to be precise in mathematics.  Sometimes though, we can relax a little bit, as long as we all agree on a convention.  An example of such a convention is to assume that sentences containing predicates with free variables are intended as statements, where the variables are universally quantified.%
\par
For example, do you believe that if a shape is a square, then it is a rectangle?  But how can that be true if it is not a statement?  To be a little more precise, we have two predicates: \(S(x)\) standing for ``\(x\) is a square'' and \(R(x)\) standing for ``\(x\) is a rectangle''.  The \emph{sentence} we are looking at is,%
\begin{equation*}
S(x) \imp R(x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This is neither true nor false, as it is not a statement.  But come on!  We all know that we meant to consider the statement,%
\begin{equation*}
\forall x (S(x) \imp R(x))\text{,}
\end{equation*}
and this is what our convention tells us to consider.%
\par
Similarly, we will often be a bit sloppy about the distinction between a predicate and a statement.  For example, we might write, \emph{let \(P(n)\) be the \emph{statement}, ``\(n\) is prime,''} which is technically incorrect.  It is implicit that we mean that we are defining \(P(n)\) to be a predicate, which for each \(n\) becomes the statement, \(n\) is prime.%

\begin{introduction}{}%
The most fundamental objects we will use in our studies (and really in all of math) are \emph{sets}. Much of what follows might be review, but it is very important that you are fluent in the language of set theory. Most of the notation we use below is standard, although some might be a little different than what you have seen before.%
\par
For us, a \terminology{set} \index{set} will simply be an unordered collection of objects. Two examples: we could consider the set of all actors who have played \emph{The Doctor} on \emph{Doctor Who}, \index{Doctor Who} or the set of natural numbers between 1 and 10 inclusive. In the first case, Tom Baker is a element (or member) of the set, while Idris Elba, among many others, is not an element of the set. Also, the two examples are of different sets. Two sets are equal exactly if they contain the exact same elements. For example, the set containing all of the vowels in the declaration of independence is precisely the same set as the set of vowels in the word ``questionably'' (namely, all of them); we do not care about order or repetitions, just whether the element is in the set or not.%
\end{introduction}%
%
%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection B.2.1 Notation}
\typeout{************************************************}
%
\begin{subsectionptx}{Notation}{}{Notation}{}{}{x:subsection:subsec_notation}
We need some notation to make talking about sets easier. Consider,%
\begin{equation*}
A = \{1, 2, 3\}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
This is read, ``\(A\) is the set containing the elements 1, 2 and 3.'' We use curly braces ``\(\{,~~ \}\)'' to enclose elements of a set. Some more notation:%
\begin{equation*}
a \in \{a, b, c\}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
The symbol ``\(\in\)'' is read ``is in'' or ``is an element of.'' Thus the above means that \(a\) is an element of the set containing the letters \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Note that this is a true statement. It would also be true to say that \(d\) is not in that set:%
\begin{equation*}
d \not\in \{a, b, c\}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Be warned: we write ``\(x \in A\)'' when we wish to express that one of the elements of the set \(A\) is \(x\). For example, consider the set,%
\begin{equation*}
A = \{1, b, \{x, y, z\}, \emptyset\}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
This is a strange set, to be sure. It contains four elements: the number 1, the letter b, the set \(\{x,y,z\}\), and the empty set \(\emptyset = \{ \}\), the set containing no elements. Is \(x\) in \(A\)? The answer is no. None of the four elements in \(A\) are the letter \(x\), so we must conclude that \(x \notin A\). Similarly, consider the set \(B = \{1,b\}\). Even though the elements of \(B\) are elements of \(A\), we cannot say that the \emph{set} \(B\) is one of the elements of \(A\). Therefore \(B \notin A\). (Soon we will see that \(B\) is a \emph{subset} of \(A\), but this is different from being an \emph{element} of \(A\).)%
\par
We have described the sets above by listing their elements. Sometimes this is hard to do, especially when there are a lot of elements in the set (perhaps infinitely many). For instance, if we want \(A\) to be the set of all even natural numbers, would could write,%
\begin{equation*}
A = \{0, 2, 4, 6, \ldots\}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
but this is a little imprecise. A better way would be%
\begin{equation*}
A = \{x \in \N \st \exists n\in \N ( x = 2 n)\}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Let's look at this carefully.  First, there are some new symbols to digest: ``\(\N\)'' is the symbol usually used to denote that \terminology{natural numbers}, which we will take to be the set \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}\).   Next, the colon, ``:'', is read \emph{such that}; it separates the elements that are in the set from the condition that the elements in the set must satisfy. So putting this all together, we would read the set as, ``the set of all \(x\) in the natural numbers, such that there exists some \(n\) in the natural numbers for which \(x\) is twice \(n\).'' In other words, the set of all natural numbers, that are even.  Here is another way to write the same set.%
\begin{equation*}
A = \{x \in \N \st x\text{ is even} \}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Note: Sometimes mathematicians use \(|\) or \(\backepsilon\) for the ``such that'' symbol instead of the colon. Also, there is a fairly even split between mathematicians about whether \(0\) is an element of the natural numbers, so be careful there.%
\par
This notation is usually called \terminology{set builder notation}. It tells use how to \emph{build} a set by telling us pricisely the condition elements must meet to gain access (the condition is the logical statement after the ``\(\st\)'' symbol).  Reading and comprehending sets written in this way takes practice. Here are some more examples:%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:Csh}%
Describe each of the following sets both in words and by listing out enough elements to see the pattern.%
\par
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}\(\{x \st x + 3 \in \N\}\).%
\item{}\(\{x \in \N \st x + 3 \in \N\}\).%
\item{}\(\{x \st x \in \N \vee -x \in \N\}\).%
\item{}\(\{x \st x \in \N \wedge -x \in \N\}\).%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:koD}{}\quad{}%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}This is the set of all numbers which are 3 less than a natural number (i.e., that if you add 3 to them, you get a natural number). The set could also be written as \(\{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}\) (note that 0 is a natural number, so \(-3\) is in this set because \(-3 + 3 = 0\)).%
\item{}This is the set of all natural numbers which are 3 less than a natural number. So here we just have \(\{0, 1, 2,3 \ldots\}\).%
\item{}This is the set of all integers \index{integers} (positive and negative whole numbers, written \(\Z\)). In other words, \(\{\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots\}\).%
\item{}Here we want all numbers \(x\) such that \(x\) and \(-x\) are natural numbers. There is only one: 0. So we have the set \(\{0\}\).%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{example}
There is also a subtle variation on set builder notation.  While the condition is generally given after the ``such that'', sometimes it is hidden in the first part.  Here is an example.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:izq}%
List a few elements in the sets below and describe them in words.  The set \(\Z\) is the set of \terminology{integers}; positive and negative whole numbers.%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}\(A = \{x \in \Z \st x^2 \in \N\}\)%
\item{}\(B = \{x^2 \st x \in \N\}\)%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:QvM}{}\quad{}%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}The set of integers that pass the condition that their square is a natural number.  Well, every integer, when you square it, gives you a non-negative integer, so a natural number.  Thus \(A = \Z = \{\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}\).%
\item{}Here we are looking for the set of all \(x^2\)s where \(x\) is a natural number.  So this set is simply the set of perfect squares.  \(B = \{0, 1, 4, 9, 16, \ldots\}\).%
\par
Another way we could have written this set, using more strict set builder notation, would be as \(B = \{x \in \N \st x = n^2 \text{ for some } n \in \N\}\).%
\end{enumerate}
%

\begin{subsectionptx}{Relationships Between Sets}{}{Relationships Between Sets}{}{}{p:subsection:xIo}
We have already said what it means for two sets to be equal: they have exactly the same elements. Thus, for example,%
\begin{equation*}
\{1, 2, 3\} = \{2, 1, 3\}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
(Remember, the order the elements are written down in does not matter.) Also,%
\begin{equation*}
\{1, 2, 3\} = \{1, 1+1, 1+1+1\} = \{I, II, III\} = \{1, 2, 3, 1+2\}
\end{equation*}
since these are all ways to write the set containing the first three positive integers (how we write them doesn't matter, just what they are).%
\par
What about the sets \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\)? Clearly \(A \ne B\), but notice that every element of \(A\) is also an element of \(B\). Because of this we say that \(A\) is a \emph{subset} \index{subset} of \(B\), or in symbols \(A \subset B\) or \(A \subseteq B\). Both symbols are read ``is a subset of.'' The difference is that sometimes we want to say that \(A\) is either equal to or is a subset of \(B\), in which case we use \(\subseteq\). This is analogous to the difference between \(\lt\) and \(\le\).%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:uNI}%
Let \(A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), \(B = \{2, 4, 6\}\), \(C = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(D = \{7, 8, 9\}\). Determine which of the following are true, false, or meaningless.%
\par
%
\begin{multicols}{3}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}\(A \subset B\).%
\item{}\(B \subset A\).%
\item{}\(B \in C\).%
\item{}\(\emptyset \in A\).%
\item{}\(\emptyset \subset A\).%
\item{}\(A \lt D\).%
\item{}\(3 \in C\).%
\item{}\(3 \subset C\).%
\item{}\(\{3\} \subset C\).%
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}
%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:wCV}{}\quad{}%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}False. For example, \(1\in A\) but \(1 \notin B\).%
\item{}True. Every element in \(B\) is an element in \(A\).%
\item{}False. The elements in \(C\) are 1, 2, and 3. The \emph{set} \(B\) is not equal to 1, 2, or 3.%
\item{}False. \(A\) has exactly 6 elements, and none of them are the empty set.%
\item{}True. Everything in the empty set (nothing) is also an element of \(A\). Notice that the empty set is a subset of every set.%
\item{}Meaningless. A set cannot be less than another set.%
\item{}True. \(3\) is one of the elements of the set \(C\).%
\item{}Meaningless. \(3\) is not a set, so it cannot be a subset of another set.%
\item{}True. \(3\) is the only element of the set \(\{3\}\), and is an element of \(C\), so every element in \(\{3\}\) is an element of \(C\).%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{example}
In the example above, \(B\) is a subset of \(A\). You might wonder what other sets are subsets of \(A\). If you collect all these subsets of \(A\) into a new set, we get a set of sets. We call the set of all subsets of \(A\) the \terminology{power set} \index{power set} of \(A\), and write it \(\pow(A)\).%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:aUR}%
Let \(A = \{1,2,3\}\). Find \(\pow(A)\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:cKe}{}\quad{}\(\pow(A)\) is a set of sets, all of which are subsets of \(A\). So%
\begin{equation*}
\pow(A) = \{ \emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{1,2\}, \{1, 3\}, \{2,3\}, \{1,2,3\}\}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Notice that while \(2 \in A\), it is wrong to write \(2 \in \pow(A)\) since none of the elements in \(\pow(A)\) are numbers! On the other hand, we do have \(\{2\} \in \pow(A)\) because \(\{2\} \subseteq A\).%
\par
What does a subset of \(\pow(A)\) look like? Notice that \(\{2\} \not\subseteq \pow(A)\) because not everything in \(\{2\}\) is in \(\pow(A)\). But we do have \(\{ \{2\} \} \subseteq \pow(A)\). The only element of \(\{\{2\}\}\) is the set \(\{2\}\) which is also an element of \(\pow(A)\). We could take the collection of all subsets of \(\pow(A)\) and call that \(\pow(\pow(A))\). Or even the power set of that set of sets of sets.%
\end{example}
Another way to compare sets is by their \emph{size}. Notice that in the example above, \(A\) has 6 elements and \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) all have 3 elements. The size of a set is called the set's \terminology{cardinality} . \index{cardinality} We would write \(|A| = 6\), \(|B| = 3\), and so on. For sets that have a finite number of elements, the cardinality of the set is simply the number of elements in the set. Note that the cardinality of \(\{ 1, 2, 3, 2, 1\}\) is 3. We do not count repeats (in fact, \(\{1, 2, 3, 2, 1\}\) is exactly the same set as \(\{1, 2, 3\}\)). There are sets with infinite cardinality, such as \(\N\), the set of rational numbers (written \(\mathbb Q\)), the set of even natural numbers, and the set of real numbers (\(\mathbb R\)). It is possible to distinguish between different infinite cardinalities, but that is beyond the scope of this text. For us, a set will either be infinite, or finite; if it is finite, the we can determine its cardinality by counting elements.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:Hca}%
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}Find the cardinality of \(A = \{23, 24, \ldots, 37, 38\}\).%
\item{}Find the cardinality of \(B = \{1, \{2, 3, 4\}, \emptyset\}\).%
\item{}If \(C = \{1,2,3\}\), what is the cardinality of \(\pow(C)\)?%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:IRn}{}\quad{}%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}Since \(38 - 23 = 15\), we can conclude that the cardinality of the set is \(|A| = 16\) (you need to add one since 23 is included).%
\item{}Here \(|B| = 3\). The three elements are the number 1, the set \(\{2,3,4\}\), and the empty set.%
\item{}We wrote out the elements of the power set \(\pow(C)\) above, and there are 8 elements (each of which is a set). So \(\card{\pow(C)} = 8\). (You might wonder if there is a relationship between \(\card{A}\) and \(\card{\pow(A)}\) for all sets \(A\). This is a good question which we consider in to in \hyperref[x:chapter:ch_basic-combinatorics]{Chapter~\ref{x:chapter:ch_basic-combinatorics}}.)%

\typeout{Subsection B.2.3 Operations On Sets}
\typeout{************************************************}
%
\begin{subsectionptx}{Operations On Sets}{}{Operations On Sets}{}{}{p:subsection:dPx}
Is it possible to add two sets? Not really, however there is something similar. If we want to combine two sets to get the collection of objects that are in either set, then we can take the \terminology{union} \index{union} of the two sets. Symbolically,%
\begin{equation*}
C = A \cup B\text{,}
\end{equation*}
read, ``\(C\) is the union of \(A\) and \(B\),'' means that the elements of \(C\) are exactly the elements which are either an element of \(A\) or an element of \(B\) (or an element of both). For example, if \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(B = \{2, 3, 4\}\), then \(A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\).%
\par
The other common operation on sets is \terminology{intersection}. \index{intersection} We write,%
\begin{equation*}
C = A \cap B
\end{equation*}
and say, ``\(C\) is the intersection of \(A\) and \(B\),'' when the elements in \(C\) are precisely those both in \(A\) and in \(B\). So if \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(B = \{2, 3, 4\}\), then \(A \cap B = \{2, 3\}\).%
\par
Often when dealing with sets, we will have some understanding as to what ``everything'' is. Perhaps we are only concerned with natural numbers. In this case we would say that our \terminology{universe} is \(\N\). Sometimes we denote this universe by \(\U\). Given this context, we might wish to speak of all the elements which are \emph{not} in a particular set. We say \(B\) is the \terminology{complement} \index{complement} of \(A\), and write,%
\begin{equation*}
B = \bar A
\end{equation*}
when \(B\) contains every element not contained in \(A\). So, if our universe is \(\{1, 2,\ldots, 9, 10\}\), and \(A = \{2, 3, 5, 7\}\), then \(\bar A = \{1, 4, 6, 8, 9,10\}\).%
\par
Of course we can perform more than one operation at a time. For example, consider%
\begin{equation*}
A \cap \bar B\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
This is the set of all elements which are both elements of \(A\) and not elements of \(B\). What have we done? We've started with \(A\) and removed all of the elements which were in \(B\). Another way to write this is the \terminology{set difference}: \index{set difference} \index{difference, of sets}%
\begin{equation*}
A \cap \bar B = A \setminus B\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
It is important to remember that these operations (union, intersection, complement, and difference) on sets produce other sets. Don't confuse these with the symbols from the previous section (element of and subset of). \(A \cap B\) is a set, while \(A \subseteq B\) is true or false. This is the same difference as between \(3 + 2\) (which is a number) and \(3 \le 2\) (which is false).%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:njj}%
Let \(A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), \(B = \{2, 4, 6\}\), \(C = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(D = \{7, 8, 9\}\). If the universe is \(\U = \{1, 2, \ldots, 10\}\), find:%
\begin{multicols}{3}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}\(A \cup B\).%
\item{}\(A \cap B\).%
\item{}\(B \cap C\).%
\item{}\(A \cap D\).%
\item{}\(\bar{B \cup C}\).%
\item{}\(A \setminus B\).%
\item{}\((D \cap \bar C) \cup \bar{A \cap B}\).%
\item{}\(\emptyset \cup C\).%
\item{}\(\emptyset \cap C\).%
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}
%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:oYw}{}\quad{}%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}\(A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} = A\) since everything in \(B\) is already in \(A\).%
\item{}\(A \cap B = \{2, 4, 6\} = B\) since everything in \(B\) is in \(A\).%
\item{}\(B \cap C = \{2\}\) as the only element of both \(B\) and \(C\) is 2.%
\item{}\(A \cap D = \emptyset\) since \(A\) and \(D\) have no common elements.%
\item{}\(\bar{B \cup C} = \{5, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\). First we find that \(B \cup C = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 6\}\), then we take everything not in that set.%
\item{}\(A \setminus B = \{1, 3, 5\}\) since the elements 1, 3, and 5 are in \(A\) but not in \(B\). This is the same as \(A \cap \bar B\).%
\item{}\((D \cap \bar C) \cup \bar{A \cap B} = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\). The set contains all elements that are either in \(D\) but not in \(C\) (i.e., \(\{7,8,9\}\)), or not in both \(A\) and \(B\) (i.e., \(\{1,3,5,7,8,9,10\}\)).%
\item{}\(\emptyset \cup C = C\) since nothing is added by the empty set.%
\item{}\(\emptyset \cap C = \emptyset\) since nothing can be both in a set and in the empty set.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{example}
Having notation like this is useful.  We will often want to add or remove elements from sets, and our notation allows us to do so precisely.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:Tqs}%
If \(A = \{1,2,3\}\), then we can describe the set we get by adding the number 4 as \(A \cup \{4\}\).  If we want to express the set we get by removing the number 2 from \(A\) we can do so by writing \(A \setminus \{2\}\).%
\par
Careful though.  If you add an element to the set, you get a new set!  So you would have \(B = A \cup \{4\}\) and then correctly say that \(B\) contains 4, but \(A\) does not.%
\end{example}
You might notice that the symbols for union and intersection slightly resemble the logic symbols for ``or'' and ``and.'' This is no accident. What does it mean for \(x\) to be an element of \(A\cup B\)? It means that \(x\) is an element of \(A\) \emph{or} \(x\) is an element of \(B\) (or both). That is,%
\begin{equation*}
x \in A \cup B \qquad \Iff \qquad x \in A \vee x \in B\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Similarly,%
\begin{equation*}
x \in A \cap B \qquad \Iff \qquad x \in A \wedge x \in B\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Also,%
\begin{equation*}
x \in \bar A \qquad \Iff \qquad \neg (x \in A)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
which says \(x\) is an element of the complement of \(A\) if \(x\) is not an element of \(A\).%
\par
There is one more way to combine sets which will be useful for us: the \terminology{Cartesian product}, \index{Cartesian product} \(A \times B\). \label{g:notation:idp403349920704} This sounds fancy but is nothing you haven't seen before. When you graph a function in calculus, you graph it in the Cartesian plane. This is the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers \((x,y)\). We can do this for \emph{any} pair of sets, not just the real numbers with themselves.%
\par
Put another way, \(A \times B = \{(a,b) \st a \in A \wedge b \in B\}\). The first coordinate comes from the first set and the second coordinate comes from the second set. Sometimes we will want to take the Cartesian product of a set with itself, and this is fine: \(A \times A = \{(a,b) \st a, b \in A\}\) (we might also write \(A^2\) for this set). Notice that in \(A \times A\), we still want \emph{all} ordered pairs, not just the ones where the first and second coordinate are the same. We can also take products of 3 or more sets, getting ordered triples, or quadruples, and so on.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:zxB}%
Let \(A = \{1,2\}\) and \(B = \{3,4,5\}\). Find \(A \times B\) and \(A \times A\). How many elements do you expect to be in \(B \times B\)?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:VfF}{}\quad{}\(A \times B = \{(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\}\).%
\par
\(A \times A = A^2 = \{(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)\}\).%
\par
\(|B\times B| = 9\). There will be 3 pairs with first coordinate \(3\), three more with first coordinate \(4\), and a final three with first coordinate \(5\).%

There is a very nice visual tool we can use to represent operations on sets. A \terminology{Venn diagram} displays sets as intersecting circles. \index{Venn diagram} We can shade the region we are talking about when we carry out an operation. We can also represent cardinality of a particular set by putting the number in the corresponding region.%
\begin{sidebyside}{2}{0.08}{0.08}{0.16}%
\begin{sbspanel}{0.34}%
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{%

\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
Each circle represents a set. The rectangle containing the circles represents the universe. To represent combinations of these sets, we shade the corresponding region. For example, we could draw \(A \cap B\) as:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0.33}{0.33}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{0.34}%
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{%
        \begin{tikzpicture}[fill=gray!50,scale=0.85]

Here is a representation of \(A \cap \bar B\), or equivalently \(A \setminus B\):%

 \draw[thick] \circleA \circleAlabel \circleB \circleBlabel \twosetbox;

\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
A more complicated example is \((B \cap C) \cup (C \cap \bar A)\), as seen below.%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0.37}{0.37}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{0.26}%

\end{tikzpicture}
}%
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
Notice that the shaded regions above could also be arrived at in another way. We could have started with all of \(C\), then excluded the region where \(C\) and \(A\) overlap outside of \(B\). That region is \((A \cap C) \cap \bar B\). So the above Venn diagram also represents \(C \cap \bar{\left((A\cap C)\cap \bar B\right)}\). So using just the picture, we have determined that%
\begin{equation*}
(B \cap C) \cup (C \cap \bar A) = C \cap \bar{\left((A\cap C)\cap \bar B\right)}\text{.}

\begin{sectionptx}{Functions}{}{Functions}{}{}{x:section:sec_background-functions}
\(\textit{}\)\begin{introduction}{}%
A \terminology{function} \index{function} is a rule that assigns each input exactly one output. We call the output the \terminology{image} of the input. The set of all inputs for a function is called the \terminology{domain}. \index{domain} The set of all allowable outputs is called the \terminology{codomain}. \index{codomain} We would write \(f:X \to Y\) to describe a function with name \(f\), domain \(X\) and codomain \(Y\). This does not tell us \emph{which} function \(f\) is though. To define the function, we must describe the rule. This is often done by giving a formula to compute the output for any input (although this is certainly not the only way to describe the rule).%
\par
For example, consider the function \(f:\N \to \N\) defined by \(f(x) = x^2 + 3\). Here the domain and codomain are the same set (the natural numbers). The rule is: take your input, multiply it by itself and add 3. This works because we can apply this rule to every natural number (every element of the domain) and the result is always a natural number (an element of the codomain). Notice though that not every natural number is actually an output (there is no way to get 0, 1, 2, 5, etc.). The set of natural numbers that \emph{are} outputs is called the \terminology{range} \index{range} of the function (in this case, the range is \(\{3, 4, 7, 12, 19, 28, \ldots\}\), all the natural numbers that are 3 more than a perfect square).%
\par
The key thing that makes a rule a \emph{function} is that there is \emph{exactly one} output for each input. That is, it is important that the rule be a good rule. What output do we assign to the input 7? There can only be one answer for any particular function.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:ZIh}%
The following are all examples of functions:%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}\(f:\Z \to \Z\) defined by \(f(n) = 3n\). The domain and codomain are both the set of integers. However, the range is only the set of integer multiples of 3.%
\item{}\(g: \{1,2,3\} \to \{a,b,c\}\) defined by \(g(1) = c\), \(g(2) = a\) and \(g(3) = a\). The domain is the set \(\{1,2,3\}\), the codomain is the set \(\{a,b,c\}\) and the range is the set \(\{a,c\}\). Note that \(g(2)\) and \(g(3)\) are the same element of the codomain. This is okay since each element in the domain still has only one output.%
\item{}\(h:\{1,2,3,4\} \to \N\) defined by the table:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0}{0}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{1}%
{\centering%
\begin{tabular}{lllll}
\multicolumn{1}{cA}{\(x\)}&1&2&3&4\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\multicolumn{1}{cA}{\(h(x)\)}&3&6&9&12
\end{tabular}
\par}
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
Here the domain is the finite set \(\{1,2,3,4\}\) and to codomain is the set of natural numbers, \(\N\). At first you might think this function is the same as \(f\) defined above. It is absolutely not. Even though the rule is the same, the domain and codomain are different, so these are two different functions.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{example}
\begin{example}{}{p:example:FPq}%
Just because you can describe a rule in the same way you would write a function, does not mean that the rule is a function. The following are NOT functions.%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}\(f:\N \to \N\) defined by \(f(n) = \frac{n}{2}\). The reason this is not a function is because not every input has an output. Where does \(f\) send 3? The rule says that \(f(3) = \frac{3}{2}\), but \(\frac{3}{2}\) is not an element of the codomain.%
\item{}Consider the rule that matches each person to their phone number. If you think of the set of people as the domain and the set of phone numbers as the codomain, then this is not a function, since some people have two phone numbers. Switching the domain and codomain sets doesn't help either, since some phone numbers belong to multiple people (assuming some households still have landlines when you are reading this).%
\end{enumerate}

%
\begin{subsectionptx}{Describing Functions}{}{Describing Functions}{}{}{p:subsection:irZ}
It is worth making a distinction between a function and its description. The function is the abstract mathematical object that in some way exists whether or not anyone ever talks about it. But when we \emph{do} want to talk about the function, we need a way to describe it. A particular function can be described in multiple ways.%
\par
Some calculus textbooks talk about the \emph{Rule of Four}, that every function can be described in four ways: algebraically (a formula), numerically (a table), graphically, or in words. In discrete math, we can still use any of these to describe functions, but we can also be more specific since we are primarily concerned with functions that have \(\N\) or a finite subset of \(\N\) as their domain.%
\par
Describing a function graphically usually means drawing the graph of the function: plotting the points on the plain. We can do this, and might get a graph like the following for a function \(f:\{1,2,3\} \to \{1,2,3\}\).%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0.35}{0.35}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{0.3}%
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{%
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.75]
  \draw[thin, gray!50] (0,0) grid (3.5, 3.5);
  \draw[->, thick] (0,0) -- (0,3.5);
  \draw[->, thick] (0,0) -- (3.5,0);
  \fill (1,2) circle (3pt) (2,1) circle (3pt) (3,3) circle (3pt);
\end{tikzpicture}
}%
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
It would be absolutely WRONG to connect the dots or try to fit them to some curve. There are only three elements in the domain. A curve would mean that the domain contains an entire interval of real numbers.%
\par
Here is another way to represent that same function:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0.415}{0.415}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{0.17}%
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{%
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.85]
  \draw[->] (-1,1) node[above] {1} -- (0,0) node[below] {2};
  \draw[->] (0,1) node[above] {2} -- (-1,0) node[below] {1};
  \draw[->] (1,1) node[above] {3} -- (1,0) node[below] {3};
\end{tikzpicture}
}%
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
This shows that the function \(f\) sends 1 to 2, 2 to 1 and 3 to 3: just follow the arrows.%
\par
The arrow diagram used to define the function above can be very helpful in visualizing functions. We will often be working with functions with \emph{finite} domains, so this kind of picture is often more useful than a traditional graph of a function.%
\par
Note that for finite domains, finding an algebraic formula that gives the output for any input is often impossible. Of course we could use a piecewise defined function, like%
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = \begin{cases} x+1 \amp \text{ if } x = 1 \\ x-1 \amp \text{ if } x = 2 \\ x \amp \text{ if } x = 3\end{cases}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
This describes exactly the same function as above, but we can all agree is a ridiculous way of doing so.%
\par
Since we will so often use functions with small domains and codomains, let's adopt some notation to describe them. All we need is some clear way of denoting the image of each element in the domain. In fact, writing a table of values would work perfectly:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0}{0}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{1}%
{\centering%
\begin{tabular}{llllll}
\multicolumn{1}{cA}{\(x\)}&0&1&2&3&4\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\multicolumn{1}{cA}{\(f(x)\)}&3&3&2&4&1
\end{tabular}
\par}
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
We simplify this further by writing this as a matrix with each input directly over its output:%
\begin{equation*}
f = \twoline{0 \amp 1 \amp 2\amp 3 \amp 4}{3 \amp 3 \amp 2 \amp 4 \amp 1}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Note this is just notation and not the same sort of matrix you would find in a linear algebra class (it does not make sense to do operations with these matrices, or row reduce them, for example).%
\par
One advantage of the two-line notation over the arrow diagrams is that it is harder to accidentally define a rule that is not a function using two-line notation.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:Tjb}%

\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:ykR}{}\quad{}\(f\) is a function. So is \(g\). There is no problem with an element of the codomain not being the image of any input, and there is no problem with \(a\) from the codomain being the image of both 2 and 3 from the domain. We could use our two-line notation to write these as%
\begin{equation*}
f= \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \\ d \amp a \amp c \amp b \end{pmatrix} \qquad g = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \\ d \amp a \amp a \amp b \end{pmatrix}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
However, \(h\) is NOT a function. In fact, it fails for two reasons. First, the element 1 from the domain has not been mapped to any element from the codomain. Second, the element 2 from the domain has been mapped to more than one element from the codomain (\(a\) and \(c\)). Note that either one of these problems is enough to make a rule not a function. In general, neither of the following mappings are functions:%

It might also be helpful to think about how you would write the two-line notation for \(h\). We would have something like:%
\begin{equation*}
h=\twoline{1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4}{\amp a,c? \amp d \amp b}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
There is nothing under 1 (bad) and we needed to put more than one thing under 2 (very bad). With a rule that is actually a function, the two-line notation will always ``work''.%
\end{example}
We will also be interested in functions with domain \(\N\). Here two-line notation is no good, but describing the function algebraically is often possible. Even tables are a little awkward, since they do not describe the function completely. For example, consider the function \(f:\N \to \N\) given by the table below.%

Have I given you enough entries for you to be able to determine \(f(6)\)? You might guess that \(f(6) = 36\), but there is no way for you to \emph{know} this for sure. Maybe I am being a jerk and intended \(f(6) = 42\). In fact, for every natural number \(n\), there is a function that agrees with the table above, but for which \(f(6) = n\).%
\par
Okay, suppose I really did mean for \(f(6) = 36\), and in fact, for the rule that you think is governing the function to actually be the rule. Then I should say what that rule is. \(f(n) = n^2\). Now there is no confusion possible.%
\par
Giving an explicit formula that calculates the image of any element in the domain is a great way to describe a function. We will say that these explicit rules are \terminology{closed formulas} for the function. \index{closed formula!for a function}%
\par
There is another very useful way to describe functions whose domain is \(\N\), that rely specifically on the structure of the natural numbers. We can define a function \emph{recursively}!%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:zqk}%
Consider the function \(f:\N \to \N\) given by \(f(0) = 0\) and \(f(n+1) = f(n) + 2n+1\). Find \(f(6)\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:esa}{}\quad{}The rule says that \(f(6) = f(5) + 11\) (we are using \(6 = n+1\) so \(n = 5\)). We don't know what \(f(5)\) is though. Well, we know that \(f(5) = f(4) + 9\). So we need to compute \(f(4)\), which will require knowing \(f(3)\), which will require \(f(2)\),\textellipsis{} will it ever end?%
\par
Yes! In fact, this process will always end because we have \(\N\) as our domain, so there is a least element. And we gave the value of \(f(0)\) explicitly, so we are good. In fact, we might decide to work up to \(f(6)\) instead of working down from \(f(6)\):%
\begin{align*}
f(1) = \amp f(0) + 1 = \amp 0 + 1 = 1\\
f(2) = \amp f(1) + 3 = \amp 1 + 3 = 4\\
f(3) = \amp f(2) + 5 = \amp 4 + 5 = 9\\
f(4) = \amp f(3) + 7 = \amp 9 + 7 = 16\\
f(5) = \amp f(4) + 9 = \amp 16 + 9 = 25\\
f(6) = \amp f(5) + 11 = \amp 25 + 11 = 36
\end{align*}
%
\par
It looks that this recursively defined function is the same as the explicitly defined function \(f(n) = n^2\). Is it? Later we will prove that it is.%
\end{example}
Recursively defined functions are often easier to create from a ``real world'' problem, because they describe how the values of the functions are changing. However, this comes with a price. It is harder to calculate the image of a single input, since you need to know the images of other (previous) elements in the domain.%
\begin{assemblage}{Recursively Defined Functions.}{p:assemblage:aNA}%
For a function \(f:\N \to \N\), a \terminology{recursive definition} consists of an \terminology{initial condition} together with a \terminology{recurrence relation}. The initial condition is the explicitly given value of \(f(0)\). The recurrence relation is a formula for \(f(n+1)\) in terms for \(f(n)\) (and possibly \(n\) itself).%
\end{assemblage}
\begin{example}{}{p:example:fxt}%
Give recursive definitions for the functions described below.%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}\(f:\N \to \N\) gives the number of snails in your terrarium \(n\) years after you built it, assuming you started with 3 snails and the number of snails doubles each year.%
\item{}\(g:\N \to \N\) gives the number of push-ups you do \(n\) days after you started your push-ups challenge, assuming you could do 7 push-ups on day 0 and you can do 2 more push-ups each day.%
\item{}\(h:\N \to \N\) defined by \(f(n) = n!\). Recall that \(n! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \cdots \cdot (n-1)\cdot n\) is the product of all numbers from \(1\) through \(n\). We also define \(0! = 1\).%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:Kzj}{}\quad{}%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}The initial condition is \(f(0) = 3\). To get \(f(n+1)\) we would double the number of snails in the terrarium the previous year, which is given by \(f(n)\). Thus \(f(n+1) = 2f(n)\). The full recursive definition contains both of these, and would be written,%
\begin{equation*}
f(0) = 3;~ f(n+1) = 2f(n)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item{}We are told that on day 0 you can do 7 push-ups, so \(f(0) = 7\). The number of push-ups you can do on day \(n+1\) is 2 more than the number you can do on day \(n\), which is given by \(f(n)\). Thus%
\begin{equation*}
f(0) = 7;~ f(n+1) = f(n) + 2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item{}Here \(f(0) = 1\). To get the recurrence relation, think about how you can get \(f(n+1) = (n+1)!\) from \(f(n) = n!\). If you write out both of these as products, you see that \((n+1)!\) is just like \(n!\) except you have one more term in the product, an extra \(n+1\). So we have,%
\begin{equation*}
f(0) = 1;~ f(n+1) = (n+1)\cdot f(n)\text{.}
\end{equation*}

We now turn to investigating special properties functions might or might not possess.%
\par
In the examples above, you may have noticed that sometimes there are elements of the codomain which are not in the range. When this sort of the thing \emph{does not} happen, (that is, when everything in the codomain is in the range) we say the function is \terminology{onto} \index{onto} or that the function maps the domain \emph{onto} the codomain. This terminology should make sense: the function puts the domain (entirely) on top of the codomain. The fancy math term for an onto function is a \terminology{surjection}, \index{surjection} and we say that an onto function is a \terminology{surjective} function.%

\begin{enumerate}
\item{}\(f\) is not surjective. There are elements in the codomain which are not in the range. For example, no \(n \in \Z\) gets mapped to the number 1 (the rule would say that \(\frac{1}{3}\) would be sent to 1, but \(\frac{1}{3}\) is not in the domain). In fact, the range of the function is \(3\Z\) (the integer multiples of 3), which is not equal to \(\Z\).%
\item{}\(g\) is not surjective. There is no \(x \in \{1,2,3\}\) (the domain) for which \(g(x) = b\), so \(b\), which is in the codomain, is not in the range. Notice that there is an element from the codomain ``missing'' from the bottom row of the matrix.%
\item{}\(h\) is surjective. Every element of the codomain is also in the range. Nothing in the codomain is missed.%

%
\end{example}
To be a function, a rule cannot assign a single element of the domain to two or more different elements of the codomain. However, we have seen that the reverse \emph{is} permissible: a function might assign the same element of the codomain to two or more different elements of the domain. When this \emph{does not} occur (that is, when each element of the codomain is the image of at most one element of the domain) then we say the function is \terminology{one-to-one}. \index{one-to-one} Again, this terminology makes sense: we are sending at most one element from the domain to one element from the codomain. One input to one output. The fancy math term for a one-to-one function is an \terminology{injection}. \index{injection} We call one-to-one functions \terminology{injective} functions.%

\end{example}
Be careful: ``surjective'' and ``injective'' are NOT opposites. You can see in the two examples above that there are functions which are surjective but not injective, injective but not surjective, both, or neither. In the case when a function is both one-to-one and onto (an injection and surjection), we say the function is a \terminology{bijection}, \index{bijection} or that the function is a \terminology{bijective} function.%
\par
To illustrate the contrast between these two properties, consider a more formal definition of each, side by side.%
\begin{assemblage}{Injective vs Surjective.}{p:assemblage:GUJ}%
A function is \terminology{injective} provided every element of the codomain is the image of \emph{at most} one element from the domain.%
\par
A function is \terminology{surjective} provided every element of the codomain is the image of \emph{at least} one element from the domain.%
\end{assemblage}
Notice both properties are determined by what happens to elements of the codomain: they could be repeated as images or they could be ``missed'' (not be images). Injective functions do not have repeats but might or might not miss elements. Surjective functions do not miss elements, but might or might not have repeats. The bijective functions are those that do not have repeats and do not miss elements.%

%
\begin{subsectionptx}{Image and Inverse Image}{}{Image and Inverse Image}{}{}{p:subsection:uGr}
When discussing functions, we have notation for talking about an element of the domain (say \(x\)) and its corresponding element in the codomain (we write \(f(x)\), which \emph{is} the image of \(x\)). Sometimes we will want to talk about all the elements that are images of some subset of the domain. It would also be nice to start with some element of the codomain (say \(y\)) and talk about which element or elements (if any) from the domain it is the image of. We could write ``those \(x\) in the domain such that \(f(x) = y\),'' but this is a lot of writing. Here is some notation to make our lives easier.%
\par
To address the first situation, what we are after is a way to describe the \emph{set} of images of elements in some subset of the domain. Suppose \(f:X \to Y\) is a function and that \(A \subseteq X\) is some subset of the domain (possibly all of it). We will use the notation \(f(A)\) to denote the \terminology{image of \(A\) under \(f\)}, namely the set of elements in \(Y\) that are the image of elements from \(A\). That is, \(f(A) = \{f(a) \in Y \st a \in A\}\). \label{g:notation:idp403350884320}%
\par
We can do this in the other direction as well. We might ask which elements of the domain get mapped to a particular set in the codomain. Let \(f:X \to Y\) be a function and suppose \(B \subseteq Y\) is a subset of the codomain. Then we will write \(f\inv(B)\) for the \terminology{inverse image of \(B\) under \(f\)}, namely the set of elements in \(X\) whose image are elements in \(B\). In other words, \(f\inv(B) = \{x \in X \st f(x) \in B\}\). \label{g:notation:idp403350890992}%
\par
Often we are interested in the element(s) whose image is a particular element \(y\) of in the codomain. The notation above works: \(f\inv(\{y\})\) is the set of all elements in the domain that \(f\) sends to \(y\). It makes sense to think of this as a set: there might not be anything sent to \(y\) (if \(y\) is not in the range), in which case \(f\inv(\{y\}) = \emptyset\). Or \(f\) might send multiple elements to \(y\) (if \(f\) is not injective). As a notational convenience, we usually drop the set braces around the \(y\) and write \(f\inf(y)\) instead for this set.%
\par
WARNING: \(f\inv(y)\) is not an inverse function! Inverse functions only exist for bijections, but \(f\inv(y)\) is defined for any function \(f\). The point: \(f\inv(y)\) is a \emph{set}, not an \emph{element} of the domain. This is just sloppy notation for \(f\inv(\{y\})\). To help make this distinction, we would call \(f\inv(y)\) the \terminology{complete inverse image of \(y\) under \(f\)}. It is not the image of \(y\) under \(f\inv\) (since the function \(f\inv\) might not exist).%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:hmG}%

\begin{equation*}
f = \begin{pmatrix}1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5 \amp 6 \\ a \amp a \amp b \amp b \amp b \amp c\end{pmatrix}\text{.}

\(f\inf(\{a,b\}) = \{1,2,3,4,5\}\) since these are exactly the elements that \(f\) sends to \(a\) and \(b\).%
\par
\(f\inf(d) = \emptyset\) since \(d\) is not in the range of \(f\).%
\end{example}
\begin{example}{}{p:example:NtP}%
Consider the function \(g:\Z \to \Z\) defined by \(g(n) = n^2 + 1\). Find \(g(1)\) and \(g(\{1\})\). Then find \(g\inv(1)\), \(g\inv(2)\), and \(g\inv(3)\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:jbT}{}\quad{}Note that \(g(1) \ne g(\{1\})\). The first is an element: \(g(1) = 2\). The second is a set: \(g(\{1\}) = \{2\}\).%
\par
To find \(g\inv(1)\), we need to find all integers \(n\) such that \(n^2 + 1 = 1\). Clearly only 0 works, so \(g\inv(1) = \{0\}\) (note that even though there is only one element, we still write it as a set with one element in it).%
\par
To find \(g\inv(2)\), we need to find all \(n\) such that \(n^2 + 1 = 2\). We see \(g\inv(2) = \{-1,1\}\).%
\par
Finally, if \(n^2 + 1 = 3\), then we are looking for an \(n\) such that \(n^2 = 2\). There are no such integers so \(g\inv(3) = \emptyset\).%
\end{example}
Since \(f\inv(y)\) is a set, it makes sense to ask for \(\card{f\inv(y)}\), the number of elements in the domain which map to \(y\).%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:tAY}%

\begin{paragraphs}{Function Definitions.}{p:paragraphs:nbS}%
Here is a summary of all the main concepts and definitions we use when working with functions.%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}A \terminology{function} is a rule that assigns each element of a set, called the \terminology{domain}, to exactly one element of a second set, called the \terminology{codomain}.%
\item{}Notation: \(f:X \to Y\) is our way of saying that the function is called \(f\), the domain is the set \(X\), and the codomain is the set \(Y\).%
\item{}To specify the rule for a function with small domain, use \terminology{two-line notation} by writing a matrix with each output directly below its corresponding input, as in:%
\begin{equation*}
f = \begin{pmatrix}1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \\ 2 \amp 1 \amp 3 \amp 1 \end{pmatrix}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\item{}\(f(x) = y\) means the element \(x\) of the domain (input) is assigned to the element \(y\) of the codomain. We say \(y\) is an output. Alternatively, we call \(y\) the \terminology{image of \(x\) under \(f\)}.%
\item{}The \terminology{range} is a subset of the codomain. It is the set of all elements which are assigned to at least one element of the domain by the function. That is, the range is the set of all outputs.%
\item{}A function is \terminology{injective} (an \terminology{injection} or \terminology{one-to-one}) if every element of the codomain is the image of \terminology{at most} one element from the domain.%
\item{}A function is \terminology{surjective} (a \terminology{surjection} or \terminology{onto}) if every element of the codomain is the image of \terminology{at least} one element from the domain.%
\item{}A \terminology{bijection} is a function which is both an injection and surjection. In other words, if every element of the codomain is the image of \terminology{exactly one} element from the domain.%

Note that with the initial condition \(f(0) = 1\), the values of the function are: \(f(1) = 4\), \(f(2) = 2\), \(f(3) = 1\), \(f(4) = 4\), and so on, the images cycling through those three numbers.

A \terminology{proposition} \index{proposition} is simply a statement. \terminology{Propositional logic} studies the ways statements can interact with each other. It is important to remember that propositional logic does not really care about the content of the statements. For example, in terms of propositional logic, the claims, ``if the moon is made of cheese then basketballs are round,'' and ``if spiders have eight legs then Sam walks with a limp'' are exactly the same. They are both implications: statements of the form, \(P \imp Q\).%

Here's a question about playing Monopoly:%
\begin{quote}%
If you get more doubles than any other player then you will lose, or if you lose then you must have bought the most properties.%
\end{quote}
True or false? We will answer this question, and won't need to know anything about Monopoly. Instead we will look at the logical \emph{form} of the statement.%
\par
We need to decide when the statement \((P \imp Q) \vee (Q \imp R)\) is true. Using the definitions of the connectives in \hyperref[x:section:sec_background-statements]{Section~\ref{x:section:sec_background-statements}}, we see that for this to be true, either \(P \imp Q\) must be true or \(Q \imp R\) must be true (or both). Those are true if either \(P\) is false or \(Q\) is true (in the first case) and \(Q\) is false or \(R\) is true (in the second case). So\textemdash{}yeah, it gets kind of messy. Luckily, we can make a chart to keep track of all the possibilities. Enter \terminology{truth tables}. The idea is this: on each row, we list a possible combination of T's and F's (for true and false) for each of the sentential variables, and then mark down whether the statement in question is true or false in that case. We do this for every possible combination of T's and F's. Then we can clearly see in which cases the statement is true or false. For complicated statements, we will first fill in values for each part of the statement, as a way of breaking up our task into smaller, more manageable pieces.%
\par
Since the truth value of a statement is completely determined by the truth values of its parts and how they are connected, all you really need to know is the truth tables for each of the logical connectives. Here they are:%

None of these truth tables should come as a surprise; they are all just restating the definitions of the connectives. Let's try another one.%
\begin{example}{}{x:example:ex-imp-disj}%
Make a truth table for the statement \(\neg P \vee Q\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:QRL}{}\quad{}Note that this statement is not \(\neg(P \vee Q)\), the negation belongs to \(P\) alone. Here is the truth table:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0}{0}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{1}%

\begin{tabular}{cAcBcAc}
\(P\)&\(Q\)&\(\neg P\)&\(\neg P \vee Q\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin

\par}
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
We added a column for \(\neg P\) to make filling out the last column easier. The entries in the \(\neg P\) column were determined by the entries in the \(P\) column. Then to fill in the final column, look only at the column for \(Q\) and the column for \(\neg P\) and use the rule for \(\vee\).%
\end{example}
Now let's answer our question about monopoly:%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:Nnl}%
Analyze the statement, ``if you get more doubles than any other player you will lose, or that if you lose you must have bought the most properties,'' using truth tables.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:wYU}{}\quad{}Represent the statement in symbols as \((P \imp Q) \vee (Q \imp R)\), where \(P\) is the statement ``you get more doubles than any other player,'' \(Q\) is the statement ``you will lose,'' and \(R\) is the statement ``you must have bought the most properties.'' Now make a truth table.%
\par
The truth table needs to contain 8 rows in order to account for every possible combination of truth and falsity among the three statements. Here is the full truth table:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0}{0}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{1}%
{\centering%
\begin{tabular}{cAcAcBcAcAc}
\(P\)&\(Q\)&\(R\)&\(P \imp Q\)&\(Q \imp R\)&\((P \imp Q) \vee (Q \imp R)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin

F&F&F&T&T&T
\end{tabular}
\par}
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
The first three columns are simply a systematic listing of all possible combinations of T and F for the three statements (do you see how you would list the 16 possible combinations for four statements?). The next two columns are determined by the values of \(P\), \(Q\), and \(R\) and the definition of implication. Then, the last column is determined by the values in the previous two columns and the definition of \(\vee\). It is this final column we care about.%
\par
Notice that in each of the eight possible cases, the statement in question is true. So our statement about monopoly is true (regardless of how many properties you own, how many doubles you roll, or whether you win or lose).%
\end{example}
The statement about monopoly is an example of a \terminology{tautology}, \index{tautology} a statement which is true on the basis of its logical form alone. Tautologies are always true but they don't tell us much about the world. No knowledge about monopoly was required to determine that the statement was true. In fact, it is equally true that ``If the moon is made of cheese, then Elvis is still alive, or if Elvis is still alive, then unicorns have 5 legs.''%

You might have noticed in \hyperref[x:example:ex-imp-disj]{Example~\ref{x:example:ex-imp-disj}} that the final column in the truth table for \(\neg P \vee Q\) is identical to the final column in the truth table for \(P \imp Q\):%

This says that no matter what \(P\) and \(Q\) are, the statements \(\neg P \vee Q\) and \(P \imp Q\) either both true or both false. We therefore say these statements are \terminology{logically equivalent}.%
\begin{assemblage}{Logical Equivalence.}{p:assemblage:cwj}%
Two (molecular) statements \(P\) and \(Q\) are \terminology{logically equivalent} \index{logical equivalence} provided \(P\) is true precisely when \(Q\) is true. That is, \(P\) and \(Q\) have the same truth value under any assignment of truth values to their atomic parts.%
\par
To verify that two statements are logically equivalent, you can make a truth table for each and check whether the columns for the two statements are identical.%
\end{assemblage}
Recognizing two statements as logically equivalent can be very helpful. Rephrasing a mathematical statement can often lend insight into what it is saying, or how to prove or refute it. By using truth tables we can systematically verify that two statements are indeed logically equivalent.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:RXe}%
Are the statements, ``it will not rain or snow'' and ``it will not rain and it will not snow'' logically equivalent?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:dgd}{}\quad{}We want to know whether \(\neg(P \vee Q)\) is logically equivalent to \(\neg P \wedge \neg Q\). Make a truth table which includes both statements:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0}{0}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{1}%
{\centering%
\begin{tabular}{cAcBcAc}
\(P\)&\(Q\)&\(\neg(P \vee Q)\)&\(\neg P \wedge \neg Q\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin

F&T&F&F\tabularnewline[0pt]
F&F&T&T
\end{tabular}
\par}
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
Since in every row the truth values for the two statements are equal, the two statements are logically equivalent.%
\end{example}
Notice that this example gives us a way to ``distribute'' a negation over a disjunction (an ``or''). We have a similar rule for distributing over conjunctions (``and''s):%
\begin{assemblage}{De Morgan's Laws.}{p:assemblage:IDs}%
\index{De Morgan's laws}%
\begin{equation*}
\neg(P \wedge Q) \text{ is logically equivalent to } \neg P \vee \neg Q\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
\neg(P \vee Q) \text{ is logically equivalent to } \neg P \wedge \neg Q\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
This suggests there might be a sort of ``algebra'' you could apply to statements (okay, there is: it is called \emph{Boolean algebra}) to transform one statement into another. We can start collecting useful examples of logical equivalence, and apply them in succession to a statement, instead of writing out a complicated truth table.%
\par
De Morgan's laws do not do not directly help us with implications, but as we saw above, every implication can be written as a disjunction:%
\begin{assemblage}{Implications are Disjuctions.}{x:assemblage:assemblage-imp-disj}%
%
\begin{equation*}
P \imp Q \text{ is logically equivalent to } \neg P \vee Q\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Example: ``If a number is a multiple of 4, then it is even'' is equivalent to, ``a number is not a multiple of 4 or (else) it is even.''%
\end{assemblage}
With this and De Morgan's laws, you can take any statement and \emph{simplify} it to the point where negations are only being applied to atomic propositions.  Well, actually not, because you could get multiple negations stacked up.  But this can be easily dealt with:%
\begin{assemblage}{Double Negation.}{p:assemblage:URK}%
\index{double negation}%
\begin{equation*}
\neg \neg P \text{ is logically equivalent to } P\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Example: ``It is not the case that \(c\) is not odd'' means ``\(c\) is odd.''%
\end{assemblage}
Let's see how we can apply the equivalences we have encountered so far.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:yen}%
Prove that the statements \(\neg(P \imp Q)\) and \(P\wedge \neg Q\) are logically equivalent without using truth tables.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:Jnm}{}\quad{}We want to start with one of the statements, and transform it into the other through a sequence of logically equivalent statements. Start with \(\neg(P \imp Q)\). We can rewrite the implication as a disjunction this is logically equivalent to%
\begin{equation*}
\neg(\neg P \vee Q)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Now apply DeMorgan's law to get%
\begin{equation*}
\neg\neg P \wedge \neg Q\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Finally, use double negation to arrive at \(P \wedge \neg Q\)%
\end{example}
Notice that the above example illustrates that the negation of an implication is NOT an implication: it is a conjunction!  We saw this before, in \hyperref[x:section:sec_background-statements]{Section~\ref{x:section:sec_background-statements}}, but it is so important and useful, it warants a second blue box here:%
\begin{assemblage}{Negation of an Implication.}{x:assemblage:assemblage-negimp-again}%
The negation of an implication is a conjuction:%
\begin{equation*}
\neg(P \imp Q) \text{ is logically equivalent to } P \wedge \neg Q\text{.}
\end{equation*}
That is, the only way for an implication to be false is for the hypothesis to be true \emph{AND} the conclusion to be false.%
\end{assemblage}
To verify that two statements are logically equivalent, you can use truth tables or a sequence of logically equivalent replacements. The truth table method, although cumbersome, has the advantage that it can verify that two statements are NOT logically equivalent.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:elw}%
Are the statements \((P \vee Q) \imp R\) and \((P \imp R) \vee (Q \imp R)\) logically equivalent?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:puv}{}\quad{}Note that while we could start rewriting these statements with logically equivalent replacements in the hopes of transforming one into another, we will never be sure that our failure is due to their lack of logical equivalence rather than our lack of imagination. So instead, let's make a truth table:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0}{0}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{1}%
{\centering%
\begin{tabular}{cAcAcBcAc}
\(P\)&\(Q\)&\(R\)&\((P\vee Q) \imp R\)&\((P\imp R) \vee (Q \imp R)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin

F&F&F&T&T\tabularnewline[0pt]

\end{tabular}
\par}
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
Look at the fourth (or sixth) row. In this case, \((P \imp R) \vee (Q \imp R)\) is true, but \((P \vee Q) \imp R\) is false. Therefore the statements are not logically equivalent.%
\par
While we don't have logical equivalence, it is the case that whenever \((P \vee Q) \imp R\) is true, so is \((P \imp R) \vee (Q \imp R)\). This tells us that we can \emph{deduce} \((P \imp R) \vee (Q \imp R)\) from \((P \vee Q) \imp R\), just not the reverse direction.%

Earlier we claimed that the following was a valid argument:%
\begin{quote}%
If Edith eats her vegetables, then she can have a cookie. Edith ate her vegetables. Therefore Edith gets a cookie.%
\end{quote}
How do we know this is valid? Let's look at the form of the statements. Let \(P\) denote ``Edith eats her vegetables'' and \(Q\) denote ``Edith can have a cookie.'' The logical form of the argument is then:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0}{0}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{1}%

\begin{tabular}{cc}

This is an example of a \terminology{deduction rule}, \index{deduction rule} an argument form which is always valid. This one is a particularly famous rule called \textit{modus ponens}. \index{\emph{modus ponens}} Are you convinced that it is a valid deduction rule? If not, consider the following truth table:%

This is just the truth table for \(P \imp Q\), but what matters here is that all the lines in the deduction rule have their own column in the truth table. Remember that an argument is valid provided the conclusion must be true given that the premises are true. The premises in this case are \(P \imp Q\) and \(P\). Which \emph{rows} of the truth table correspond to both of these being true? \(P\) is true in the first two rows, and of those, only the first row has \(P \imp Q\) true as well. And lo-and-behold, in this one case, \(Q\) is also true. So if \(P\imp Q\) and \(P\) are both true, we see that \(Q\) must be true as well.%

As we saw in \hyperref[x:section:sec_background-statements]{Section~\ref{x:section:sec_background-statements}}, not every statement can be analyzed using logical connectives alone. For example, we might want to work with the statement:%
\begin{quote}%
All primes greater than 2 are odd.%
\end{quote}
To write this statement symbolically, we must use quantifiers. We can translate as follows:%
\begin{equation*}
\forall x ((P(x) \wedge x \gt 2) \imp O(x))\text{.}
\end{equation*}
In this case, we are using \(P(x)\) to denote ``\(x\) is prime'' and \(O(x)\) to denote ``\(x\) is odd.'' These are not propositions, since their truth value depends on the input \(x\). Better to think of \(P\) and \(O\) as denoting \emph{properties} of their input. The technical term for these is \terminology{predicates} and when we study them in logic, we need to use \terminology{predicate logic}.%
\par
It is important to stress that predicate logic \emph{extends} propositional logic (much in the way quantum mechanics extends classical mechanics). You will notice that our statement above still used the (propositional) logical connectives. Everything that we learned about logical equivalence and deductions still applies. However, predicate logic allows us to analyze statements at a higher resolution, digging down into the individual propositions \(P\), \(Q\), etc.%
\par
A full treatment of predicate logic is beyond the scope of this text. One reason is that there is no systematic procedure for deciding whether two statements in predicate logic are logically equivalent (i.e., there is no analogue to truth tables here). Rather, we end with a two examples of logical equivalence and deduction, to pique your interest.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:MhS}%
Suppose we claim that there is no smallest number. We can translate this into symbols as%
\begin{equation*}
\neg \exists x \forall y (x \le y)
\end{equation*}
(literally, ``it is not true that there is a number \(x\) such that for all numbers \(y\), \(x\) is less than or equal to \(y\)'').%
\par
However, we know how negation interacts with quantifiers: we can pass a negation over a quantifier by switching the quantifier type (between universal and existential). So the statement above should be \emph{logically equivalent} to%
\begin{equation*}
\forall x \exists y (y \lt x)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Notice that \(y \lt x\) is the negation of \(x \le y\). This literally says, ``for every number \(x\) there is a number \(y\) which is smaller than \(x\).'' We see that this is another way to make our original claim.%
\end{example}
\begin{example}{}{p:example:spb}%
Can you switch the order of quantifiers? For example, consider the two statements:%
\begin{equation*}
\forall x \exists y P(x,y) \qquad \mathrm{ and } \qquad \exists y \forall x P(x,y)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
Are these logically equivalent?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:hPW}{}\quad{}These statements are NOT logically equivalent. To see this, we should provide an interpretation of the predicate \(P(x,y)\) which makes one of the statements true and the other false.%
\par
Let \(P(x,y)\) be the predicate \(x \lt y\). It is true, in the natural numbers, that for all \(x\) there is some \(y\) greater than that \(x\) (since there are infinitely many numbers). However, there is not a natural number \(y\) which is greater than every number \(x\). Thus it is possible for \(\forall x \exists y P(x,y)\) to be true while \(\exists y \forall x P(x,y)\) is false.%
\par
We cannot do the reverse of this though. If there is some \(y\) for which every \(x\) satisfies \(P(x,y)\), then certainly for every \(x\) there is some \(y\) which satisfies \(P(x,y)\). The first is saying we can find one \(y\) that works for every \(x\). The second allows different \(y\)'s to work for different \(x\)'s, but there is nothing preventing us from using the same \(y\) that work for every \(x\). In other words, while we don't have logical equivalence between the two statements, we do have a valid deduction rule:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0}{0}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{1}%
{\centering%
\begin{tabular}{cc}
&\(\exists y \forall x P(x,y)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(\therefore\)&\(\forall x \exists y P(x,y)\)
\end{tabular}
\par}
\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
Put yet another way, this says that the single statement%
\begin{equation*}
\exists y \forall x P(x,y) \imp \forall x \exists y P(x,y)
\end{equation*}
is always true. This is sort of like a tautology, although we reserve that term for necessary truths in propositional logic. A statement in predicate logic that is necessarily true gets the more prestigious designation of a \terminology{law of logic} \index{law of logic} (or sometimes \terminology{logically valid}, \index{logically valid|see{law of logic}} but that is less fun).%

ab \amp =(2k+1)(2m+1)\\

Therefore \(ab\) is odd.%

Thus \(ab\) is even.%

2n \amp =4kj+2k+2j+1\\
n \amp = 2kj+k+j+\frac{1}{2}\text{.}

But since \(2kj+k+j\) is an integer, this says that the integer \(n\) is equal to a non-integer, which is impossible.%

Anyone who doesn't believe there is creativity in mathematics clearly has not tried to write proofs. Finding a way to convince the world that a particular statement is necessarily true is a mighty undertaking and can often be quite challenging. There is not a guaranteed path to success in the search for proofs. For example, in the summer of 1742, a German mathematician by the name of Christian Goldbach wondered whether every even integer greater than 2 could be written as the sum of two primes. Centuries later, we still don't have a proof of this apparent fact (computers have checked that ``Goldbach's Conjecture'' holds for all numbers less than \(4\times 10^{18}\), which leaves only infinitely many more numbers to check).%
\par
Writing proofs is a bit of an art. Like any art, to be truly great at it, you need some sort of inspiration, as well as some foundational technique. Just as musicians can learn proper fingering, and painters can learn the proper way to hold a brush, we can look at the proper way to construct arguments. A good place to start might be to study a classic.%
\begin{theorem}{}{}{p:theorem:LFc}%
There are infinitely many primes. \index{prime numbers}%
\end{theorem}
\begin{proofptx}{}{p:proof:qGS}
Suppose this were not the case. That is, suppose there are only finitely many primes. Then there must be a last, largest prime, call it \(p\). Consider the number%
\begin{equation*}
N = p! + 1 = (p \cdot (p-1) \cdot \cdots 3\cdot 2 \cdot 1) + 1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Now \(N\) is certainly larger than \(p\). Also, \(N\) is not divisible by any number less than or equal to \(p\), since every number less than or equal to \(p\) divides \(p!\). Thus the prime factorization of \(N\) contains prime numbers (possibly just \(N\) itself) all greater than \(p\). So \(p\) is not the largest prime, a contradiction. Therefore there are infinitely many primes.%
\end{proofptx}
This proof is an example of a \emph{proof by contradiction}, one of the standard styles of mathematical proof. First and foremost, the proof is an argument. It contains sequence of statements, the last being the \emph{conclusion} which follows from the previous statements. The argument is valid so the conclusion must be true if the premises are true. Let's go through the proof line by line.%
\par
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}Suppose there are only finitely many primes. \emph{[this is a premise. Note the use of ``suppose.'']}%
\item{}There must be a largest prime, call it \(p\). \emph{[follows from line 1, by the definition of ``finitely many.'']}%
\item{}Let \(N = p! + 1\). \emph{[basically just notation, although this is the inspired part of the proof; looking at \(p! + 1\) is the key insight.]}%
\item{}\(N\) is larger than \(p\). \emph{[by the definition of \(p!\)]}%
\item{}\(N\) is not divisible by any number less than or equal to \(p\). \emph{[by definition, \(p!\) is divisible by each number less than or equal to \(p\), so \(p! + 1\) is not.]}%
\item{}The prime factorization of \(N\) contains prime numbers greater than \(p\). \emph{[since \(N\) is divisible by each prime number in the prime factorization of \(N\), and by line 5.]}%
\item{}Therefore \(p\) is not the largest prime. \emph{[by line 6, \(N\) is divisible by a prime larger than \(p\).]}%
\item{}This is a contradiction. \emph{[from line 2 and line 7: the largest prime is \(p\) and there is a prime larger than \(p\).]}%
\item{}Therefore there are infinitely many primes. \emph{[from line 1 and line 8: our only premise lead to a contradiction, so the premise is false.]}%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par
We should say a bit more about the last line. Up through line 8, we have a valid argument with the premise ``there are only finitely many primes'' and the conclusion ``there is a prime larger than the largest prime.'' This is a valid argument as each line follows from previous lines. So if the premises are true, then the conclusion \emph{must} be true. However, the conclusion is NOT true. The only way out: the premise must be false.%
\par
The sort of line-by-line analysis we did above is a great way to really understand what is going on. Whenever you come across a proof in a textbook, you really should make sure you understand what each line is saying and why it is true. Additionally, it is equally important to understand the overall structure of the proof. This is where using tools from logic is helpful. Luckily there are a relatively small number of standard proof styles that keep showing up again and again. Being familiar with these can help understand proof, as well as give ideas of how to write your own.%

\begin{subsectionptx}{Direct Proof}{}{Direct Proof}{}{}{p:subsection:Ruo}
\index{direct proof}%
The simplest (from a logic perspective) style of proof is a \terminology{direct proof}. Often all that is required to prove something is a systematic explanation of what everything means. Direct proofs are especially useful when proving implications. The general format to prove \(P \imp Q\) is this:%
\begin{quote}%
Assume \(P\). Explain, explain, \textellipsis{}, explain. Therefore \(Q\).%
\end{quote}
Often we want to prove universal statements, perhaps of the form \(\forall x (P(x) \imp Q(x))\). Again, we will want to assume \(P(x)\) is true and deduce \(Q(x)\). But what about the \(x\)? We want this to work for \emph{all} \(x\). We accomplish this by fixing \(x\) to be an arbitrary element (of the sort we are interested in).%
\par
Here are a few examples. First, we will set up the proof structure for a direct proof, then fill in the details.%

Prove: For all integers \(n\), if \(n\) is even, then \(n^2\) is even.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:EaD}{}\quad{}The format of the proof will be this: Let \(n\) be an arbitrary integer. Assume that \(n\) is even. Explain explain explain. Therefore \(n^2\) is even.%
\par
To fill in the details, we will basically just explain what it means for \(n\) to be even, and then see what that means for \(n^2\). Here is a complete proof.%
\begin{proofptx}{}{p:proof:khM}
Let \(n\) be an arbitrary integer. Suppose \(n\) is even. Then \(n = 2k\) for some integer \(k\). Now \(n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)\). Since \(2k^2\) is an integer, \(n^2\) is even.%
\end{proofptx}
\end{example}
\begin{example}{}{p:example:Clq}%
Prove: For all integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), if \(a|b\) and \(b|c\) then \(a|c\). (Here \(x|y\), read ``\(x\) divides \(y\)'' means that \(y\) is a multiple of \(x\), i.e., that \(x\) will divide into \(y\) without remainder).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:QoV}{}\quad{}Even before we know what the divides symbol means, we can set up a direct proof for this statement. It will go something like this: Let \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) be arbitrary integers. Assume that \(a|b\) and \(b|c\). Dot dot dot. Therefore \(a|c\).%
\par
How do we connect the dots? We say what our hypothesis (\(a|b\) and \(b|c\)) really means and why this gives us what the conclusion (\(a|c\)) really means. Another way to say that \(a|b\) is to say that \(b = ka\) for some integer \(k\) (that is, that \(b\) is a multiple of \(a\)). What are we going for? That \(c = la\), for some integer \(l\) (because we want \(c\) to be a multiple of \(a\)). Here is the complete proof.%
\begin{proofptx}{}{p:proof:wwe}
Let \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) be integers. Assume that \(a|b\) and \(b|c\). In other words, \(b\) is a multiple of \(a\) and \(c\) is a multiple of \(b\). So there are integers \(k\) and \(j\) such that \(b = ka\) and \(c = jb\). Combining these (through substitution) we get that \(c = jka\). But \(jk\) is an integer, so this says that \(c\) is a multiple of \(a\). Therefore \(a|c\).%

\index{proof by contrapositive}%
Recall that an implication \(P \imp Q\) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive \(\neg Q \imp \neg P\). There are plenty of examples of statements which are hard to prove directly, but whose contrapositive can easily be proved directly. This is all that \terminology{proof by contrapositive} does. It gives a direct proof of the contrapositive of the implication. This is enough because the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication.%
\par
The skeleton of the proof of \(P \imp Q\) by contrapositive will always look roughly like this:%
\begin{quote}%
Assume \(\neg Q\). Explain, explain, \textellipsis{} explain. Therefore \(\neg P\).%
\end{quote}
As before, if there are variables and quantifiers, we set them to be arbitrary elements of our domain. Here are two examples:%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:isz}%
Is the statement ``for all integers \(n\), if \(n^2\) is even, then \(n\) is even'' true?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:cDn}{}\quad{}This is the converse of the statement we proved above using a direct proof. From trying a few examples, this statement definitely appears to be true. So let's prove it.%
\par
A direct proof of this statement would require fixing an arbitrary \(n\) and assuming that \(n^2\) is even. But it is not at all clear how this would allow us to conclude anything about \(n\). Just because \(n^2 = 2k\) does not in itself suggest how we could write \(n\) as a multiple of 2.%
\par
Try something else: write the contrapositive of the statement. We get, for all integers \(n\), if \(n\) is odd then \(n^2\) is odd. This looks much more promising. Our proof will look something like this:%
\par
Let \(n\) be an arbitrary integer. Suppose that \(n\) is not even. This means that \textellipsis{}. In other words \textellipsis{}. But this is the same as saying \textellipsis{}. Therefore \(n^2\) is not even.%
\par
Now we fill in the details:%
\begin{proofptx}{}{p:proof:IKw}
We will prove the contrapositive. Let \(n\) be an arbitrary integer. Suppose that \(n\) is not even, and thus odd. Then \(n= 2k+1\) for some integer \(k\). Now \(n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1\). Since \(2k^2 + 2k\) is an integer, we see that \(n^2\) is odd and therefore not even.%
\end{proofptx}
\end{example}
\begin{example}{}{p:example:OzI}%
Prove: for all integers \(a\) and \(b\), if \(a + b\) is odd, then \(a\) is odd or \(b\) is odd.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:oRF}{}\quad{}The problem with trying a direct proof is that it will be hard to separate \(a\) and \(b\) from knowing something about \(a+b\). On the other hand, if we know something about \(a\) and \(b\) separately, then combining them might give us information about \(a+b\). The contrapositive of the statement we are trying to prove is: for all integers \(a\) and \(b\), if \(a\) and \(b\) are even, then \(a+b\) is even. Thus our proof will have the following format:%
\par
Let \(a\) and \(b\) be integers. Assume that \(a\) and \(b\) are both even. la la la. Therefore \(a+b\) is even.%
\par
Here is a complete proof:%
\begin{proofptx}{}{p:proof:UYO}
Let \(a\) and \(b\) be integers. Assume that \(a\) and \(b\) are even. Then \(a = 2k\) and \(b = 2l\) for some integers \(k\) and \(l\). Now \(a + b = 2k + 2l = 2(k+1)\). Since \(k + l\) is an integer, we see that \(a + b\) is even, completing the proof.%
\end{proofptx}
Note that our assumption that \(a\) and \(b\) are even is really the negation of \(a\) or \(b\) is odd. We used De Morgan's law here.%
\end{example}
We have seen how to prove some statements in the form of implications: either directly or by contrapositive. Some statements are not written as implications to begin with.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:uGR}%
Consider the following statement: for every prime number \(p\), either \(p = 2\) or \(p\) is odd. We can rephrase this: for every prime number \(p\), if \(p \ne 2\), then \(p\) is odd. Now try to prove it.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:BfX}{}\quad{}\begin{proofptx}{}{p:proof:hng}
Let \(p\) be an arbitrary prime number. Assume \(p\) is not odd. So \(p\) is divisible by 2. Since \(p\) is prime, it must have exactly two divisors, and it has 2 as a divisor, so \(p\) must be divisible by only 1 and 2. Therefore \(p = 2\). This completes the proof (by contrapositive).%

Well, say we want to prove the statement \(P\). What if we could prove that \(\neg P \imp Q\) where \(Q\) was false? If this implication is true, and \(Q\) is false, what can we say about \(\neg P\)? It must be false as well, which makes \(P\) true!%
\par
This is why \terminology{proof by contradiction} works. If we can prove that \(\neg P\) leads to a contradiction, then the only conclusion is that \(\neg P\) is false, so \(P\) is true. That's what we wanted to prove. In other words, if it is impossible for \(P\) to be false, \(P\) must be true.%
\par
Here are three examples of proofs by contradiction:%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:aOa}%
Prove that \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:Nup}{}\quad{}\begin{proofptx}{}{p:proof:tBy}
Suppose not. Then \(\sqrt 2\) is equal to a fraction \(\frac{a}{b}\). Without loss of generality, assume \(\frac{a}{b}\) is in lowest terms (otherwise reduce the fraction). So,%
\begin{equation*}
2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
2b^2 = a^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Thus \(a^2\) is even, and as such \(a\) is even. So \(a = 2k\) for some integer \(k\), and \(a^2 = 4k^2\). We then have,%
\begin{equation*}
2b^2 = 4k^2
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
b^2 = 2k^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Thus \(b^2\) is even, and as such \(b\) is even. Since \(a\) is also even, we see that \(\frac{a}{b}\) is not in lowest terms, a contradiction. Thus \(\sqrt 2\) is irrational.%
\end{proofptx}
\end{example}
\begin{example}{}{p:example:GVj}%
Prove: There are no integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x^2 = 4y + 2\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:ZIH}{}\quad{}\begin{proofptx}{}{p:proof:FPQ}
We proceed by contradiction. So suppose there \emph{are} integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x^2 = 4y + 2 = 2(2y + 1)\). So \(x^2\) is even. We have seen that this implies that \(x\) is even. So \(x = 2k\) for some integer \(k\). Then \(x^2 = 4k^2\). This in turn gives \(2k^2 = (2y + 1)\). But \(2k^2\) is even, and \(2y + 1\) is odd, so these cannot be equal. Thus we have a contradiction, so there must not be any integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x^2 = 4y + 2\).%
\end{proofptx}
\end{example}
\begin{example}{}{p:example:ncs}%
The \terminology{Pigeonhole Principle}: \index{pigeonhole principle} If more than \(n\) pigeons fly into \(n\) pigeon holes, then at least one pigeon hole will contain at least two pigeons. Prove this!%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:lWZ}{}\quad{}\begin{proofptx}{}{p:proof:Sei}
Suppose, contrary to stipulation, that each of the pigeon holes contains at most one pigeon. Then at most there will be \(n\) pigeons. But we assumed that there are more than \(n\) pigeons, so this is impossible. Thus there must be a pigeonhole with more than one pigeon.%
\end{proofptx}
While we phrased this proof as a proof by contradiction, we could have also used a proof by contrapositive since our contradiction was simply the negation of the hypothesis. Sometimes this will happen, in which case you can use either style of proof. There are examples however where the contradiction occurs ``far away'' from the original statement.%

\index{counterexample}%
It is almost NEVER okay to prove a statement with just an example. Certainly none of the statements proved above can be proved through an example. This is because in each of those cases we are trying to prove that something holds of all integers. We claim that \(n^2\) being even implies that \(n\) is even, \emph{no matter what integer} \(n\) we pick. Showing that this works for \(n = 4\) is not even close to enough.%
\par
This cannot be stressed enough. If you are trying to prove a statement of the form \(\forall x P(x)\), you absolutely CANNOT prove this with an example.\footnote{This is not to say that looking at examples is a waste of time. Doing so will often give you an idea of how to write a proof. But the examples do not belong in the proof.\label{g:fn:idp403352646336}}%
\par
However, existential statements can be proven this way. If we want to prove that there is an integer \(n\) such that \(n^2-n+41\) is not prime, all we need to do is find one. This might seem like a silly thing to want to prove until you try a few values for \(n\).%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0}{0}{0}%
\begin{sbspanel}{1}%
{\centering%
\begin{tabular}{cccccccc}
\multicolumn{1}{cA}{\(n\)}&1&2&3&4&5&6&7\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\multicolumn{1}{cA}{\(n^2 - n + 41\)}&41&43&47&53&61&71&83
\end{tabular}

\end{sbspanel}%
\end{sidebyside}%
\par
So far we have gotten only primes. You might be tempted to conjecture, ``For all positive integers \(n\), the number \(n^2 - n + 41\) is prime.'' If you wanted to prove this, you would need to use a direct proof, a proof by contrapositive, or another style of proof, but certainly it is not enough to give even 7 examples. In fact, we can prove this conjecture is \emph{false} by proving its negation: ``There is a positive integer \(n\) such that \(n^2 - n + 41\) is not prime.'' Since this is an existential statement, it suffices to show that there does indeed exist such a number.%
\par
In fact, we can quickly see that \(n = 41\) will give \(41^2\) which is certainly not prime. You might say that this is a counterexample to the conjecture that \(n^2 - n + 41\) is always prime. Since so many statements in mathematics are universal, making their negations existential, we can often prove that a statement is false (if it is) by providing a counterexample.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:TjB}%
Above we proved, ``for all integers \(a\) and \(b\), if \(a+b\) is odd, then \(a\) is odd or \(b\) is odd.'' Is the converse true?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:ylr}{}\quad{}The converse is the statement, ``for all integers \(a\) and \(b\), if \(a\) is odd or \(b\) is odd, then \(a + b\) is odd.'' This is false! How do we prove it is false? We need to prove the negation of the converse. Let's look at the symbols. The converse is%
\begin{equation*}
\forall a \forall b ((O(a) \vee O(b)) \imp O(a+b))\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
We want to prove the negation:%
\begin{equation*}
\neg \forall a \forall b ((O(a) \vee O(b)) \imp O(a+b))\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Simplify using the rules from the previous sections:%
\begin{equation*}
\exists a \exists b ((O(a) \vee O(b)) \wedge \neg O(a+b))\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
As the negation passed by the quantifiers, they changed from \(\forall\) to \(\exists\). We then needed to take the negation of an implication, which is equivalent to asserting the if part and not the then part.%
\par
Now we know what to do. To prove that the converse is false we need to find two integers \(a\) and \(b\) so that \(a\) is odd or \(b\) is odd, but \(a+b\) is not odd (so even). That's easy: 1 and 3. (remember, ``or'' means one or the other or both). Both of these are odd, but \(1+3 = 4\) is not odd.%

We could go on and on and on about different proof styles (we haven't even mentioned induction or combinatorial proofs here), but instead we will end with one final useful technique: proof by cases. The idea is to prove that \(P\) is true by proving that \(Q \imp P\) and \(\neg Q \imp P\) for some statement \(Q\). So no matter what, whether or not \(Q\) is true, we know that \(P\) is true. In fact, we could generalize this. Suppose we want to prove \(P\). We know that at least one of the statements \(Q_1, Q_2, \ldots, Q_n\) is true. If we can show that \(Q_1 \imp P\) and \(Q_2 \imp P\) and so on all the way to \(Q_n \imp P\), then we can conclude \(P\). The key thing is that we want to be sure that one of our cases (the \(Q_i\)'s) must be true no matter what.%
\par
If that last paragraph was confusing, perhaps an example will make things better.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:fxT}%
Prove: For any integer \(n\), the number \((n^3 -n)\) is even.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:esA}{}\quad{}It is hard to know where to start this, because we don't know much of anything about \(n\). We might be able to prove that \(n^3 - n\) is even if we knew that \(n\) was even. In fact, we could probably prove that \(n^3-n\) was even if \(n\) was odd. But since \(n\) must either be even or odd, this will be enough. Here's the proof.%
\begin{proofptx}{}{p:proof:KzJ}
We consider two cases: if \(n\) is even or if \(n\) is odd.%
\par
Case 1: \(n\) is even. Then \(n = 2k\) for some integer \(k\). This give%
\begin{align*}
n^3 - n \amp = 8k^3 - 2k\\
\amp = 2(4k^2 - k)\text{,}
\end{align*}
and since \(4k^2 - k\) is an integer, this says that \(n^3-n\) is even.%
\par
Case 2: \(n\) is odd. Then \(n = 2k+1\) for some integer \(k\). This gives%
\begin{align*}
n^3 - n \amp = (2k+1)^3 - (2k+1)\\
\amp = 8k^3 + 6k^2 + 6k + 1 - 2k - 1\\
\amp = 2(4k^3 + 3k^2 + 2k)\text{,}
\end{align*}
and since \(4k^3 + 3k^2 + 2k\) is an integer, we see that \(n^3 - n\) is even again.%
\par
Since \(n^3 - n\) is even in both exhaustive cases, we see that \(n^3 - n\) is indeed always even.%

\begin{introduction}{}%
\index{induction} Mathematical induction is a proof technique, not unlike direct proof or proof by contradiction or combinatorial proof. In other words, induction is a style of argument we use to convince ourselves and others that a mathematical statement is always true. Many mathematical statements can be proved by simply explaining what they mean. Others are very difficult to prove\textemdash{}in fact, there are relatively simple mathematical statements which nobody yet knows how to prove. To facilitate the discovery of proofs, it is important to be familiar with some standard styles of arguments. Induction is one such style. Let's start with an example:%

You need to mail a package, but don't yet know how much postage you will need. You have a large supply of 8-cent stamps and 5-cent stamps. Which amounts of postage can you make exactly using these stamps? Which amounts are impossible to make?%
\end{investigation}
Perhaps in investigating the problem above you picked some amounts of postage, and then figured out whether you could make that amount using just 8-cent and 5-cent stamps. Perhaps you did this in order: can you make 1 cent of postage? Can you make 2 cents? 3 cents? And so on. If this is what you did, you were actually answering a \emph{sequence} of questions. We have methods for dealing with sequences. Let's see if that helps.%
\par
Actually, we will not make a sequence of questions, but rather a sequence of statements. Let \(P(n)\) \label{g:notation:idp403352908880} be the statement ``you can make \(n\) cents of postage using just 8-cent and 5-cent stamps.'' Since for each value of \(n\), \(P(n)\) is a statement, it is either true or false. So if we form the sequence of statements%
\begin{equation*}
P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4), \ldots\text{,}
\end{equation*}
the sequence will consist of \(T\)'s (for true) and \(F\)'s (for false). In our particular case the sequence starts%
\begin{equation*}
F,F,F,F,T,F,F,T,F,T,F,F,T,\ldots
\end{equation*}
because \(P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4)\) are all false (you cannot make 1, 2, 3, or 4 cents of postage) but \(P(5)\) is true (use one 5-cent stamp), and so on.%
\par
Let's think a bit about how we could find the value of \(P(n)\) for some specific \(n\) (the ``value'' will be either \(T\) or \(F\)). How did we find the value of the \(n\)th term of a sequence of numbers? How did we find \(a_n\)? There were two ways we could do this: either there was a closed formula for \(a_n\), so we could plug in \(n\) into the formula and get our output value, or we had a recursive definition for the sequence, so we could use the previous terms of the sequence to compute the \(n\)th term. When dealing with sequences of statements, we could use either of these techniques as well. Maybe there is a way to use \(n\) itself to determine whether we can make \(n\) cents of postage. That would be something like a closed formula. Or instead we could use the previous terms in the sequence (of statements) to determine whether we can make \(n\) cents of postage. That is, if we know the value of \(P(n-1)\), can we get from that to the value of \(P(n)\)? That would be something like a recursive definition for the sequence. Remember, finding recursive definitions for sequences was often easier than finding closed formulas. The same is true here.%
\par
Suppose I told you that \(P(43)\) was true (it is). Can you determine from this fact the value of \(P(44)\) (whether it true or false)? Yes you can. Even if we don't know how exactly we made 43 cents out of the 5-cent and 8-cent stamps, we do know that there was some way to do it. What if that way used at least three 5-cent stamps (making 15 cents)? We could replace those three 5-cent stamps with two 8-cent stamps (making 16 cents). The total postage has gone up by 1, so we have a way to make 44 cents, so \(P(44)\) is true. Of course, we assumed that we had at least three 5-cent stamps. What if we didn't? Then we must have at least three 8-cent stamps (making 24 cents). If we replace those three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent stamps (making 25 cents) then again we have bumped up our total by 1 cent so we can make 44 cents, so \(P(44)\) is true.%
\par
Notice that we have not said how to make 44 cents, just that we can, on the basis that we can make 43 cents. How do we know we can make 43 cents? Perhaps because we know we can make \(42\) \label{g:notation:idp403352928480} cents, which we know we can do because we know we can make 41 cents, and so on. It's a recursion! As with a recursive definition of a numerical sequence, we must specify our initial value. In this case, the initial value is ``\(P(1)\) is false.'' That's not good, since our recurrence relation just says that \(P(k+1)\) is true \emph{if} \(P(k)\) is also true. We need to start the process with a true \(P(k)\). So instead, we might want to use ``\(P(28)\) is true'' as the initial condition.%
\par
Putting this all together we arrive at the following fact: it is possible to (exactly) make any amount of postage greater than 27 cents using just 5-cent and 8-cent stamps.\footnote{This is not claiming that there are no amounts less than 27 cents which can also be made.\label{g:fn:idp403352934192}} In other words, \(P(k)\) is true for any \(k \ge 28\). To prove this, we could do the following:%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}Demonstrate that \(P(28)\) is true.%
\item{}Prove that if \(P(k)\) is true, then \(P(k+1)\) is true (for any \(k \ge 28\)).%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par
Suppose we have done this. Then we know that the 28th term of the sequence above is a \(T\) (using step 1, the initial condition or \terminology{base case}), and that every term after the 28th is \(T\) also (using step 2, the recursive part or \terminology{inductive case}). Here is what the proof would actually look like.%
\begin{proofptx}{}{p:proof:GHo}
Let \(P(n)\) be the statement ``it is possible to make exactly \(n\) cents of postage using 5-cent and 8-cent stamps.'' We will show \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 28\).%
\par
First, we show that \(P(28)\) is true: \(28 = 4 \cdot 5+ 1\cdot 8\), so we can make \(28\) cents using four 5-cent stamps and one 8-cent stamp.%
\par
Now suppose \(P(k)\) is true for some arbitrary \(k \ge 28\). Then it is possible to make \(k\) cents using 5-cent and 8-cent stamps. Note that since \(k \ge 28\), it cannot be that we use fewer than three 5-cent stamps \emph{and} fewer than three 8-cent stamps: using two of each would give only 26 cents. Now if we have made \(k\) cents using at least three 5-cent stamps, replace three 5-cent stamps by two 8-cent stamps. This replaces 15 cents of postage with 16 cents, moving from a total of \(k\) cents to \(k+1\) cents. Thus \(P(k+1)\) is true. On the other hand, if we have made \(k\) cents using at least three 8-cent stamps, then we can replace three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent stamps, moving from 24 cents to 25 cents, giving a total of \(k+1\) cents of postage. So in this case as well \(P(k+1)\) is true.%
\par
Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 28\).%

\begin{subsectionptx}{Formalizing Proofs}{}{Formalizing Proofs}{}{}{x:subsection:subsec_induction-formproofs}
What we did in the stamp example above works for many types of problems. Proof by induction is useful when trying to prove statements about all natural numbers, or all natural numbers greater than some fixed first case (like 28 in the example above), and in some other situations too. In particular, induction should be used when there is some way to go from one case to the next \textendash{} when you can see how to always ``do one more.''%
\par
This is a big idea. Thinking about a problem \emph{inductively} can give new insight into the problem. For example, to really understand the stamp problem, you should think about how any amount of postage (greater than 28 cents) can be made (this is non-inductive reasoning) and also how the ways in which postage can be made \emph{changes} as the amount increases (inductive reasoning). When you are asked to provide a proof by induction, you are being asked to think about the problem \emph{dynamically}; how does increasing \(n\) change the problem?%
\par
But there is another side to proofs by induction as well. In mathematics, it is not enough to understand a problem, you must also be able to communicate the problem to others. Like any discipline, mathematics has standard language and style, allowing mathematicians to share their ideas efficiently. Proofs by induction have a certain formal style, and being able to write in this style is important. It allows us to keep our ideas organized and might even help us with formulating a proof.%
\par
Here is the general structure of a proof by mathematical induction:%
\begin{assemblage}{Induction Proof Structure.}{p:assemblage:UaZ}%
\index{induction} Start by saying what the statement is that you want to prove: ``Let \(P(n)\) be the statement\textellipsis{}'' To prove that \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 0\), you must prove two facts:%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}Base case: Prove that \(P(0)\) is true. You do this directly. This is often easy.%
\item{}Inductive case: Prove that \(P(k) \imp P(k+1)\) for all \(k \ge 0\). That is, prove that for any \(k \ge 0\) if \(P(k)\) is true, then \(P(k+1)\) is true as well. This is the proof of an if \textellipsis{} then \textellipsis{} statement, so you can assume \(P(k)\) is true (\(P(k)\) is called the \emph{inductive hypothesis}). \index{inductive hypothesis} You must then explain why \(P(k+1)\) is also true, given that assumption.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par
Assuming you are successful on both parts above, you can conclude, ``Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 0\).''%
\end{assemblage}
Sometimes the statement \(P(n)\) will only be true for values of \(n \ge 4\), for example, or some other value. In such cases, replace all the 0's above with 4's (or the other value).%
\par
The other advantage of formalizing inductive proofs is it allows us to verify that the logic behind this style of argument is valid. Why does induction work? Think of a row of dominoes set up standing on their edges. We want to argue that in a minute, all the dominoes will have fallen down. For this to happen, you will need to push the first domino. That is the base case. It will also have to be that the dominoes are close enough together that when any particular domino falls, it will cause the next domino to fall. That is the inductive case. If both of these conditions are met, you push the first domino over and each domino will cause the next to fall, then all the dominoes will fall.%
\par
Induction is powerful! Think how much easier it is to knock over dominoes when you don't have to push over each domino yourself. You just start the chain reaction, and the rely on the relative nearness of the dominoes to take care of the rest.%
\par
Think about our study of sequences. It is easier to find recursive definitions for sequences than closed formulas. Going from one case to the next is easier than going directly to a particular case. That is what is so great about induction. Instead of going directly to the (arbitrary) case for \(n\), we just need to say how to get from one case to the next.%
\par
When you are asked to prove a statement by mathematical induction, you should first think about \emph{why} the statement is true, using inductive reasoning. Explain why induction is the right thing to do, and roughly why the inductive case will work. Then, sit down and write out a careful, formal proof using the structure above.%

%
\begin{subsectionptx}{Examples}{}{Examples}{}{}{x:subsection:subsec_induction-examples}
Here are some examples of proof by mathematical induction.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:sDJ}%
Prove for each natural number \(n \ge 1\) that \(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:JBU}{}\quad{}First, let's think inductively about this equation. In fact, we know this is true for other reasons (reverse and add comes to mind). But why might induction be applicable? The left-hand side adds up the numbers from 1 to \(n\). If we know how to do that, adding just one more term (\(n+1\)) would not be that hard. For example, if \(n = 100\), suppose we know that the sum of the first 100 numbers is \(5050\) (so \(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 100 = 5050\), which is true). Now to find the sum of the first 101 numbers, it makes more sense to just add 101 to 5050, instead of computing the entire sum again. We would have \(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 100 + 101 = 5050 + 101 = 5151\). In fact, it would always be easy to add just one more term. This is why we should use induction.%
\par
Now the formal proof:%
\begin{proofptx}{}{p:proof:pJd}
Let \(P(n)\) be the statement \(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). We will show that \(P(n)\) is true for all natural numbers \(n \ge 1\).%
\par
Base case: \(P(1)\) is the statement \(1 = \frac{1(1+1)}{2}\) which is clearly true.%
\par
Inductive case: Let \(k \ge 1\) be a natural number. Assume (for induction) that \(P(k)\) is true. That means \(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}\). We will prove that \(P(k+1)\) is true as well. That is, we must prove that \(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k + (k+1) = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}\). To prove this equation, start by adding \(k+1\) to both sides of the inductive hypothesis:%
\begin{equation*}
1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k + (k+1) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Now, simplifying the right side we get:%
\begin{align*}
\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + k+1 \amp = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + \frac{2(k+1)}{2}\\
\amp = \frac{k(k+1) + 2(k+1)}{2}\\
\amp = \frac{(k+2)(k+1)}{2}\text{.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
Thus \(P(k+1)\) is true, so by the principle of mathematical induction \(P(n)\) is true for all natural numbers \(n \ge 1\).%
\end{proofptx}
\end{example}
Note that in the part of the proof in which we proved \(P(k+1)\) from \(P(k)\), we used the equation \(P(k)\). This was the inductive hypothesis. Seeing how to use the inductive hypotheses is usually straight forward when proving a fact about a sum like this. In other proofs, it can be less obvious where it fits in.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:YKS}%
Prove that for all \(n \in \N\), \(6^n - 1\) is a multiple of 5.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:VQm}{}\quad{}Again, start by understanding the dynamics of the problem. What does increasing \(n\) do? Let's try with a few examples. If \(n = 1\), then yes, \(6^1 - 1 = 5\) is a multiple of 5. What does incrementing \(n\) to 2 look like? We get \(6^2 - 1 = 35\), which again is a multiple of 5. Next, \(n = 3\): but instead of just finding \(6^3 - 1\), what did the increase in \(n\) do? We will still subtract 1, but now we are multiplying by another 6 first. Viewed another way, we are multiplying a number which is one more than a multiple of 5 by 6 (because \(6^2 - 1\) is a multiple of 5, so \(6^2\) is one more than a multiple of 5). What do numbers which are one more than a multiple of 5 look like? They must have last digit 1 or 6. What happens when you multiply such a number by 6? Depends on the number, but in any case, the last digit of the new number must be a 6. And then if you subtract 1, you get last digit 5, so a multiple of 5.%
\par
The point is, every time we multiply by just one more six, we still get a number with last digit 6, so subtracting 1 gives us a multiple of 5. Now the formal proof:%
\begin{proofptx}{}{p:proof:BXv}
Let \(P(n)\) be the statement, ``\(6^n - 1\) is a multiple of 5.'' We will prove that \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \in \N\).%
\par
Base case: \(P(0)\) is true: \(6^0 -1 = 0\) which is a multiple of 5.%
\par
Inductive case: Let \(k\) be an arbitrary natural number. Assume, for induction, that \(P(k)\) is true. That is, \(6^k - 1\) is a multiple of \(5\). Then \(6^k - 1 = 5j\) for some integer \(j\). This means that \(6^k = 5j + 1\). Multiply both sides by \(6\):%
\begin{equation*}
6^{k+1} = 6(5j+1) = 30j + 6\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
But we want to know about \(6^{k+1} - 1\), so subtract 1 from both sides:%
\begin{equation*}
6^{k+1} - 1 = 30j + 5\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
Of course \(30j+5 = 5(6j+1)\), so is a multiple of 5.%
\par
Therefore \(6^{k+1} - 1\) is a multiple of 5, or in other words, \(P(k+1)\) is true. Thus, by the principle of mathematical induction \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \in \N\).%
\end{proofptx}
\end{example}
We had to be a little bit clever (i.e., use some algebra) to locate the \(6^k - 1\) inside of \(6^{k+1} - 1\) before we could apply the inductive hypothesis. This is what can make inductive proofs challenging.%
\par
In the two examples above, we started with \(n = 1\) or \(n = 0\). We can start later if we need to.%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:ESb}%
Prove that \(n^2 \lt 2^n\) for all integers \(n \ge 5\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:ieE}{}\quad{}First, the idea of the argument. What happens when we increase \(n\) by 1? On the left-hand side, we increase the base of the square and go to the next square number. On the right-hand side, we increase the power of 2. This means we double the number. So the question is, how does doubling a number relate to increasing to the next square? Think about what the difference of two consecutive squares looks like. We have \((n+1)^2 - n^2\). This factors:%
\begin{equation*}
(n+1)^2 - n^2 = (n+1-n)(n+1+n) = 2n+1\text{.}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
But doubling the right-hand side increases it by \(2^n\), since \(2^{n+1} = 2^n + 2^n\). When \(n\) is large enough, \(2^n > 2n + 1\).%
\par
What we are saying here is that each time \(n\) increases, the left-hand side grows by less than the right-hand side. So if the left-hand side starts smaller (as it does when \(n = 5\)), it will never catch up. Now the formal proof:%
\begin{proofptx}{}{p:proof:OlN}
Let \(P(n)\) be the statement \(n^2 \lt 2^n\). We will prove \(P(n)\) is true for all integers \(n \ge 5\).%
\par
Base case: \(P(5)\) is the statement \(5^2 \lt 2^5\). Since \(5^2 = 25\) and \(2^5 = 32\), we see that \(P(5)\) is indeed true.%
\par
Inductive case: Let \(k \ge 5\) be an arbitrary integer. Assume, for induction, that \(P(k)\) is true. That is, assume \(k^2 \lt  2^k\). We will prove that \(P(k+1)\) is true, i.e., \((k+1)^2 \lt  2^{k+1}\). To prove such an inequality, start with the left-hand side and work towards the right-hand side:%
\begin{align*}
(k+1)^2 \amp = k^2 + 2k + 1 \amp\\
\amp \lt 2^k + 2k + 1 \amp \ldots\text{by the inductive hypothesis.}\\
\amp \lt 2^k + 2^k \amp \ldots\text{ since } 2k + 1 \lt  2^k \text{ for }k \ge 5.\\
\amp = 2^{k+1}. \amp
\end{align*}
%
\par
Following the equalities and inequalities through, we get \((k+1)^2 \lt 2^{k+1}\), in other words, \(P(k+1)\). Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 5\).%
\end{proofptx}
\end{example}
The previous example might remind you of the \emph{racetrack principle} from calculus, which says that if \(f(a) \lt g(a)\), and \(f'(x) \lt g'(x)\) for \(x >
a\), then \(f(x) \lt g(x)\) for \(x > a\). Same idea: the larger function is increasing at a faster rate than the smaller function, so the larger function will stay larger. In discrete math, we don't have derivatives, so we look at differences. Thus induction is the way to go.%
\begin{paragraphs}{Warning:.}{p:paragraphs:Aii}%
With great power, comes great responsibility. Induction isn't magic. It seems very powerful to be able to assume \(P(k)\) is true. After all, we are trying to prove \(P(n)\) is true and the only difference is in the variable: \(k\) vs. \(n\). Are we assuming that what we want to prove is true? Not really. We assume \(P(k)\) is true only for the sake of proving that \(P(k+1)\) is true.%
\par
Still you might start to believe that you can prove anything with induction. Consider this incorrect ``proof'' that every Canadian \index{Canadians} has the same eye color: Let \(P(n)\) be the statement that any \(n\) Canadians have the same eye color. \(P(1)\) is true, since everyone has the same eye color as themselves. Now assume \(P(k)\) is true. That is, assume that in any group of \(k\) Canadians, everyone has the same eye color. Now consider an arbitrary group of \(k+1\) Canadians. The first \(k\) of these must all have the same eye color, since \(P(k)\) is true. Also, the last \(k\) of these must have the same eye color, since \(P(k)\) is true. So in fact, everyone the group must have the same eye color. Thus \(P(k+1)\) is true. So by the principle of mathematical induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n\).%
\par
Clearly something went wrong. The problem is that the proof that \(P(k)\) implies \(P(k+1)\) assumes that \(k \ge 2\). We have only shown \(P(1)\) is true. In fact, \(P(2)\) is false.%

\begin{subsectionptx}{Strong Induction}{}{Strong Induction}{}{}{x:subsection:subsec_induction-strong}
\begin{investigation}{}{p:investigation:xnC}%
Start with a square piece of paper. You want to cut this square into smaller squares, leaving no waste (every piece of paper you end up with must be a square). Obviously it is possible to cut the square into 4 squares. You can also cut it into 9 squares. It turns out you can cut the square into 7 squares (although not all the same size). What other numbers of squares could you end up with?%
\end{investigation}
Sometimes, to prove that \(P(k+1)\) is true, it would be helpful to know that \(P(k)\) \emph{and} \(P(k-1)\) \emph{and} \(P(k-2)\) are all true. Consider the following puzzle:%
\begin{quote}%
You have a rectangular chocolate bar, made up of \(n\) identical squares of chocolate. You can take such a bar and break it along any row or column. How many times will you have to break the bar to reduce it to \(n\) single chocolate squares?%
\end{quote}
At first, this question might seem impossible. Perhaps I meant to ask for the \emph{smallest} number of breaks needed? Let's investigate.%
\par
Start with some small cases. If \(n=2\), you must have a \(1\times 2\) rectangle, which can be reduced to single pieces in one break. With \(n=3\), we must have a \(1\times 3\) bar, which requires two breaks: the first break creates a single square and a \(1\times 2\) bar, which we know takes one (more) break.%
\par
What about \(n=4\)? Now we could have a \(2\times 2\) bar, or a \(1 \times 4\) bar. In the first case, break the bar into two \(2\times 2\) bars, each which require one more break (that's a total of three breaks required). If we started with a \(1 \times 4\) bar, we have choices for our first break. We could break the bar in half, creating two \(1\times 2\) bars, or we could break off a single square, leaving a \(1\times 3\) bar. But either way, we still need two more breaks, giving a total of three.%
\par
It is starting to look like no matter how we break the bar (and no matter how the \(n\) squares are arranged into a rectangle), we will always have the same number of breaks required. It also looks like that number is one less than \(n\):%
\begin{conjecture}{}{}{p:conjecture:kZk}%
Given a \(n\)-square rectangular chocolate bar, it always takes \(n-1\) breaks to reduce the bar to single squares.%
\end{conjecture}
It makes sense to prove this by induction because after breaking the bar once, you are left with \emph{smaller} chocolate bars. Reducing to smaller cases is what induction is all about. We can inductively assume we already know how to deal with these smaller bars. The problem is, if we are trying to prove the inductive case about a \((k+1)\)-square bar, we don't know that after the first break the remaining bar will have \(k\) squares. So we really need to assume that our conjecture is true for all cases less than \(k+1\).%
\par
Is it valid to make this stronger assumption? Remember, in induction we are attempting to prove that \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n\). What if that were not the case? Then there would be some first \(n_0\) for which \(P(n_0)\) was false. Since \(n_0\) is the \emph{first} counterexample, we know that \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \lt n_0\). Now we proceed to prove that \(P(n_0)\) is actually true, based on the assumption that \(P(n)\) is true for all smaller \(n\).%
\par
This is quite an advantage: we now have a stronger inductive hypothesis. We can assume that \(P(1)\), \(P(2)\), \(P(3)\), \textellipsis{} \(P(k)\) is true, just to show that \(P(k+1)\) is true. Previously, we just assumed \(P(k)\) for this purpose.%
\par
It is slightly easier if we change our variables for strong induction. Here is what the formal proof would look like:%
\begin{assemblage}{Strong Induction Proof Structure.}{p:assemblage:gpr}%
Again, start by saying what you want to prove: ``Let \(P(n)\) be the statement\textellipsis{}'' Then establish two facts:%
\begin{enumerate}
\item{}Base case: Prove that \(P(0)\) is true.%
\item{}Inductive case: Assume \(P(k)\) is true for all \(k \lt n\). Prove that \(P(n)\) is true.%
\end{enumerate}
Conclude, ``therefore, by strong induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \gt 0\).''%
\end{assemblage}
Of course, it is acceptable to replace 0 with a larger base case if needed.\footnote{Technically, strong induction does not require you to prove a separate base case. This is because when proving the inductive case, you must show that \(P(0)\) is true, assuming \(P(k)\) is true for all \(k \lt 0\). But this is not any help so you end up proving \(P(0)\) anyway. To be on the safe side, we will always include the base case separately.\label{g:fn:idp403353133040}}%
\par
Let's prove our conjecture about the chocolate bar puzzle:%
\begin{proofptx}{}{p:proof:mOx}
Let \(P(n)\) be the statement, ``it takes \(n-1\) breaks to reduce a \(n\)-square chocolate bar to single squares.''%
\par
Base case: Consider \(P(2)\). The squares must be arranged into a \(1\times 2\) rectangle, and we require \(2-1 = 1\) breaks to reduce this to single squares.%
\par
Inductive case: Fix an arbitrary \(n\ge 2\) and assume \(P(k)\) is true for all \(k \lt n\). Consider a \(n\)-square rectangular chocolate bar. Break the bar once along any row or column. This results in two chocolate bars, say of sizes \(a\) and \(b\). That is, we have an \(a\)-square rectangular chocolate bar, a \(b\)-square rectangular chocolate bar, and \(a+b = n\).%
\par
We also know that \(a \lt n\) and \(b \lt n\), so by our inductive hypothesis, \(P(a)\) and \(P(b)\) are true. To reduce the \(a\)-sqaure bar to single squares takes \(a-1\) breaks; to reduce the \(b\)-square bar to single squares takes \(b-1\) breaks. Doing this results in our original bar being reduced to single squares. All together it took the initial break, plus the \(a-1\) and \(b-1\) breaks, for a total of \(1+a-1+b-1 = a+b-1 = n-1\) breaks. Thus \(P(n)\) is true.%
\par
Therefore, by strong induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 2\).%
\end{proofptx}
Here is a more mathematically relevant example:%
\begin{example}{}{p:example:Rgt}%
Prove that any natural number greater than 1 is either prime \index{prime numbers} or can be written as the product of primes.%

\noindent\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:usW}{}\quad{}First, the idea: if we take some number \(n\), maybe it is prime. If so, we are done. If not, then it is composite, so it is the product of two smaller numbers. Each of these factors is smaller than \(n\) (but at least 2), so we can repeat the argument with these numbers. We have reduced to a smaller case.%
\par
Now the formal proof:%
\begin{proofptx}{}{p:proof:aAf}
Let \(P(n)\) be the statement, ``\(n\) is either prime or can be written as the product of primes.'' We will prove \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 2\).%
\par
Base case: \(P(2)\) is true because \(2\) is indeed prime.%
\par
Inductive case: assume \(P(k)\) is true for all \(k \lt n\). We want to show that \(P(n)\) is true. That is, we want to show that \(n\) is either prime or is the product of primes. If \(n\) is prime, we are done. If not, then \(n\) has more than 2 divisors, so we can write \(n = m_1 \cdot m_2\), with \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) less than \(n\) (and greater than 1). By the inductive hypothesis, \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) are each either prime or can be written as the product of primes. In either case, we have that \(n\) is written as the product of primes.%
\par
Thus by the strong induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 2\).%
\end{proofptx}
\end{example}
Whether you use regular induction or strong induction depends on the statement you want to prove. If you wanted to be safe, you could always use strong induction. It really is \emph{stronger}, so can accomplish everything ``weak'' induction can. That said, using regular induction is often easier since there is only one place you can use the induction hypothesis. There is also something to be said for \emph{elegance} in proofs. If you can prove a statement using simpler tools, it is nice to do so.%
\par
As a final contrast between the two forms of induction, consider once more the stamp problem. Regular induction worked by showing how to increase postage by one cent (either replacing three 5-cent stamps with two 8-cent stamps, or three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent stamps). We could give a slightly different proof using strong induction. First, we could show \emph{five} base cases: it is possible to make 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32 cents (we would actually say how each of these is made). Now assume that it is possible to make \(k\) cents of postage for all \(k \lt n\) as long as \(k \ge 28\). As long as \(n > 32\), this means in particular we can make \(k = n-5\) cents. Now add a 5-cent stamp to get make \(n\) cents.%

On the way to the market, you exchange your cow for some magic dark chocolate espresso beans. These beans have the property that every night at midnight, each bean splits into two, effectively doubling your collection. You decide to take advantage of this and each morning (around 8am) you eat 5 beans.%
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item{}Explain why it is true that \emph{if} at noon on day \(n\) you have a number of beans ending in a 5, then at noon on day \(n+1\) you will still have a number of beans ending in a 5.%
\item{}Why is the previous fact not enough to conclude that you will always have a number of beans ending in a 5? What additional fact would you need?%
\item{}Assuming you have the additional fact in part (b), and have successfully proved the fact in part (a), how do you know that you will always have a number of beans ending in a 5? Illustrate what is going on by carefully explaining how the two facts above prove that you will have a number of beans ending in a 5 on \emph{day 4} specifically. In other words, explain why induction works in this context.%

What is wrong with the following ``proof'' of the ``fact'' that \(n+3 = n+7\) for all values of \(n\) (besides of course that the thing it is claiming to prove is false)?%
\begin{proofptx}{}{p:proof:uhO}
Let \(P(n)\) be the statement that \(n + 3 = n + 7\). We will prove that \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \in \N\). Assume, for induction that \(P(k)\) is true. That is, \(k+3 = k+7\). We must show that \(P(k+1)\) is true. Now since \(k + 3 = k + 7\), add 1 to both sides. This gives \(k + 3 + 1 = k + 7 + 1\). Regrouping \((k+1) + 3 = (k+1) + 7\). But this is simply \(P(k+1)\). Thus by the principle of mathematical induction \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \in \N\).%

Find the flaw in the following ``proof'' of the ``fact'' that \(n \lt 100\) for every \(n \in \N\).%
\begin{proofptx}{}{p:proof:SKy}
Let \(P(n)\) be the statement \(n \lt 100\). We will prove \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \in \N\). First we establish the base case: when \(n = 0\), \(P(n)\) is true, because \(0 \lt 100\). Now for the inductive step, assume \(P(k)\) is true. That is, \(k \lt 100\). Now if \(k \lt 100\), then \(k\) is some number, like 80. Of course \(80+1 = 81\) which is still less than 100. So \(k +1 \lt 100\) as well. But this is what \(P(k+1)\) claims, so we have shown that \(P(k) \imp P(k+1)\). Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \in \N\).%

While the above proof does not work (it better not since the statement it is trying to prove is false!) we can prove something similar. Prove that there is a strictly increasing sequence \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\) of numbers (not necessarily integers) such that \(a_n \lt 100\) for all \(n \in \N\). (By \terminology{strictly increasing} we mean \(a_n \lt a_{n+1}\) for all \(n\). So each term must be larger than the last.)%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint}.\hypertarget{p:hint:yRH}{}\quad{}For the inductive step, you can assume you have a strictly increasing sequence up to \(a_k\) where \(a_k \lt 100\).  Now you just need to find the next term \(a_{k+1}\) so that \(a_{k} \lt a_{k+1} \lt 100\).  What should \(a_{k+1}\) be?%

What is wrong with the following ``proof'' of the ``fact'' that for all \(n \in \N\), the number \(n^2 + n\) is odd?%
\begin{proofptx}{}{p:proof:LfZ}
Let \(P(n)\) be the statement ``\(n^2 + n\) is odd.'' We will prove that \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \in \N\). Suppose for induction that \(P(k)\) is true, that is, that \(k^2 + k\) is odd. Now consider the statement \(P(k+1)\). Now \((k+1)^2 + (k+1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 + k + 1 = k^2 + k + 2k + 2\). By the inductive hypothesis, \(k^2 + k\) is odd, and of course \(2k + 2\) is even. An odd plus an even is always odd, so therefore \((k+1)^2 + (k+1)\) is odd. Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \in \N\).%

\par\smallskip%

Use induction to prove that \(\d\sum_{k=0}^n {n \choose k} = 2^n\). That is, the sum of the \(n\)th row of Pascal's Triangle is \(2^n\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint}.\hypertarget{p:hint:Ilt}{}\quad{}Here's the idea: since every entry in Pascal's Triangle is the sum of the two entries above it, we can get the \(k+1\)st row by adding up all the pairs of entry from the \(k\)th row. But doing this uses each entry on the \(k\)th row twice. Thus each time we drop to the next row, we double the total. Of course, row 0 has sum \(1 = 2^0\) (the base case). Now try to make this precise with a formal induction proof. You will use the fact that \({n \choose k} = {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}\) for the inductive case.%

Use induction to prove \({4 \choose 0} + {5 \choose 1} + {6 \choose 2} + \cdots + {4+n \choose n} = {5+n \choose n}\). (This is an example of the hockey stick theorem.)%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Hint}.\hypertarget{p:hint:osC}{}\quad{}To see why this works, try it on a copy of Pascal's triangle. We are adding up the entries along a diagonal, starting with the 1 on the left-hand side of the 4th row. Suppose we add up the first 5 entries on this diagonal. The claim is that the sum is the entry below and to the left of the last of these 5 entries. Note that if this is true, and we instead add up the first 6 entries, we will need to add the entry one spot to the right of the previous sum. But these two together give the entry below them, which is below and left of the last of the 6 entries on the diagonal. If you follow that, you can see what is going on. But it is not a great proof. A formal induction proof is needed.%

\begin{explorationsolution}{257}{}{g:exploration:idp403346532144}%
\textbf{Hint}.\hypertarget{g:hint:idp403346534416-back}\quad{}For any partition of \(k\) into parts \(\lambda_1\), \(\lambda_2\), etc. we can get a partition of \(k\) into odd parts by factoring the highest power of two that we can from each \(\lambda_i\), writing \(\lambda_i = \gamma_i\cdot 2^k_i\).  Why is \(\gamma_i\) odd? Now partition \(k\) into \(2^{k_1}\) parts of size \(\gamma_1\), \(2^{k_2}\) parts of size \(\gamma_2\), etc. and you have a partition of \(k\) into odd parts.%
\end{explorationsolution}%
\begin{explorationsolution}{258}{}{g:exploration:idp403346562432}%
\textbf{Hint}.\hypertarget{g:hint:idp403346565280-back}\quad{}Suppose we have a partition of \(k\) into distinct parts. If the smallest part, say \(m\), is smaller than the number of parts, we may add one to each of the \(m\) largest parts and delete the smallest part, and we have changed the parity of the number of parts, but we still have distinct parts. On the other hand, suppose the smallest part, again say \(m\), is larger than or equal to the number of parts. Then we can subtract 1 from each part larger than \(m\), and add a part equal to the number of parts larger than \(m\). This changes the parity of the number of parts, but if the second smallest part is \(m+1\), the resulting partition does not have distinct parts. Thus this method does not work. Further, if it did always work, the case \(k \ne \frac{3j^2+j}{2}\) would be covered also. However you can modify this method by comparing \(m\) not to the total number of parts, but to the number of rows at the top of the Young diagram that differ by exactly one from the row above. Even in this situation, there are certain slight additional assumptions you need to make, so this hint leaves you a lot of work to do. (It is reasonable to expect problems because of that exceptional case.) However, it should lead you in a useful direction.%

\item{}We cannot tell. The statement would be true if 13 is my favorite number, and false if not (since a conjunction needs both parts to be true to be true).%

\item{}The claim that \(\forall x P(x)\) means that \(P(n)\) is true no matter what \(n\) you consider in the domain of discourse. Thus the only way to prove that \(\forall x P(x)\) is true is to check or otherwise argue that \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n\) in the domain.%

\item{}This is the set \(\{3, 4, 5, \ldots \}\) since we need each element to be a natural number whose square is at least three more than 2. Since \(3^2 - 3 = 6\) but \(2^2 - 3 = 1\) we see that the first such natural number is 3.%
\item{}Here we don't specify that \(n\) must be a whole number at first, but the condition we place on it, that \(n^2 - 5 \in \N\) does guarantee this (since square a non-integer always gives a non-integer, as does subtracting 5 from a non-integer). So in fact, we get the same set as we did in the previous part, and the smallest non-negative number for which \(n^2 - 5\) is a natural numbers is 3.%
\par
Note that if we didn't specify \(n \ge 0\) then any integer less than \(-3\) would also be in the set, so there would not be a least element.%
\item{}This is the set \(\{1, 2, 5, 10, \ldots\}\text{,}\) namely the set of numbers that are the \emph{result} of squaring and adding 1 to a natural number. (\(0^2 + 1 = 1\text{,}\) \(1^2 + 1 = 2\text{,}\) \(2^2 + 1 = 5\) and so on.) Thus the least element of the set is 1.%
\item{}Now we are looking for natural numbers that are equal to taking some natural number, squaring it and adding 1. That is, \(\{1, 2, 5, 10, \ldots\}\text{,}\) the same set as the previous part. So again, the least element is 1.%

Let \(x\) and \(y\) be elements of the domain \(\Z\). Assume \(f(x) = f(y)\). If \(x\) and \(y\) are both even, then \(f(x) = x+1\) and \(f(y) = y+1\). Since \(f(x) = f(y)\), we have \(x + 1 = y + 1\) which implies that \(x = y\). Similarly, if \(x\) and \(y\) are both odd, then \(x - 3 = y-3\) so again \(x = y\). The only other possibility is that \(x\) is even an \(y\) is odd (or visa-versa). But then \(x + 1\) would be odd and \(y - 3\) would be even, so it cannot be that \(f(x) = f(y)\). Therefore if \(f(x) = f(y)\) we then have \(x = y\), which proves that \(f\) is injective.%

Let \(y\) be an element of the codomain \(\Z\). We will show there is an element \(n\) of the domain (\(\Z\)) such that \(f(n) = y\). There are two cases: First, if \(y\) is even, then let \(n = y+3\). Since \(y\) is even, \(n\) is odd, so \(f(n) = n-3 = y+3-3 = y\) as desired. Second, if \(y\) is odd, then let \(n = y-1\). Since \(y\) is odd, \(n\) is even, so \(f(n) = n+1 = y-1+1 = y\) as needed. Therefore \(f\) is surjective.%

\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:pZl-back}\quad{}In general, there is no relationship between \(\card{B}\) and \(\card{f\inv(B)}\). This is because \(B\) might contain elements that are not in the range of \(f\), so we might even have \(f\inv(B) = \emptyset\). On the other hand, there might be lots of elements from the domain that all get sent to a few elements in \(B\), making \(f\inv(B)\) larger than \(B\).%
\par
More specifically, if \(f\) is injective, then \(\card{B} \ge \card{f\inv(B)}\) (since every element in \(B\) must come from at most one element from the domain). If \(f\) is surjective, then \(\card{B} \le \card{f\inv(B)}\) (since every element in \(B\) must come from at least one element of the domain). Thus if \(f\) is bijective then \(\card{B} = \card{f\inv(B)}\).%

\begin{proofptx}{}{p:proof:ozg}
Suppose that each number only came up 6 or fewer times. So there are at most six 1's, six 2's, and so on. That's a total of 36 dice, so you must not have rolled all 40 dice.%

Suppose you roll 10 dice, but that there are NOT four matching rolls. This means at most, there are three of any given value. If we only had three different values, that would be only 9 dice, so there must be 4 different values, giving 4 dice that are all different.%

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item{}If we have a number of beans ending in a 5 and we double it, we will get a number of beans ending in a 0 (since \(5\cdot 2 = 10\) ). Then if we subtract 5, we will once again get a number of beans ending in a 5. Thus if on any day we have a number ending in a 5, the next day will also have a number ending in a 5.%
\item{}If you don't \emph{start} with a number of beans ending in a 5 (on day 1), the above reasoning is still correct but not helpful. For example, if you start with a number ending in a 3, the next day you will have a number ending in a 1.%
\item{}Part (b) is the base case and part (a) is the inductive case. If on day 1 we have a number ending in a 5 (by part (b)), then on day 2 we will also have a number ending in a 5 (by part (a)). Then by part (a) again, we will have a number ending in a 5 on day 3. By part (a) again, this means we will have a number ending in a 5 on day 4%
\par
The proof by induction would say that on \emph{every} day we will have a number ending in a 5, and this works because we can start with the base case, then use the inductive case over and over until we get up to our desired \(n\).%

We must prove that \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \cdots +2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1\) for all \(n \in \N\). Thus let \(P(n)\) be the statement \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1\). We will prove that \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \in \N\). First we establish the base case, \(P(0)\), which claims that \(1 = 2^{0+1} -1\). Since \(2^1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1\), we see that \(P(0)\) is true. Now for the inductive case. Assume that \(P(k)\) is true for an arbitrary \(k \in \N\). That is, \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^k = 2^{k+1} - 1\). We must show that \(P(k+1)\) is true (i.e., that \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^{k+1} = 2^{k+2} - 1\)). To do this, we start with the left-hand side of \(P(k+1)\) and work to the right-hand side:%
\begin{align*}
1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^k + 2^{k+1} = \amp ~ 2^{k+1} - 1 + 2^{k+1} \amp \text{by inductive hypothesis}\\
= \amp ~2\cdot 2^{k+1} - 1 \amp\\
= \amp ~ 2^{k+2} - 1 \amp
\end{align*}

Let \(P(n)\) be the statement ``\(7^n - 1\) is a multiple of 6.'' We will show \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \in \N\). First we establish the base case, \(P(0)\). Since \(7^0 - 1 = 0\), and \(0\) is a multiple of 6, \(P(0)\) is true. Now for the inductive case. Assume \(P(k)\) holds for an arbitrary \(k \in \N\). That is, \(7^k - 1\) is a multiple of 6, or in other words, \(7^k - 1 = 6j\) for some integer \(j\). Now consider \(7^{k+1} - 1\):%
\begin{align*}
7^{k+1} - 1 ~ \amp = 7^{k+1} - 7 + 6 \amp \text{by cleverness:} -1 = -7 + 6\\
\amp = 7(7^k - 1) + 6 \amp \text{factor out a 7 from the first two terms}\\
\amp = 7(6j) + 6 \amp \text{by the inductive hypothesis}\\
\amp = 6(7j + 1) \amp \text{factor out a 6}
\end{align*}
%
\par
Therefore \(7^{k+1} - 1\) is a multiple of 6, or in other words, \(P(k+1)\) is true. Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \in \N\).%

Let \(P(n)\) be the statement \(1+3 +5 + \cdots + (2n-1) = n^2\). We will prove that \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 1\). First the base case, \(P(1)\). We have \(1 = 1^2\) which is true, so \(P(1)\) is established. Now the inductive case. Assume that \(P(k)\) is true for some fixed arbitrary \(k \ge 1\). That is, \(1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k-1) = k^2\). We will now prove that \(P(k+1)\) is also true (i.e., that \(1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k+1) = (k+1)^2\)). We start with the left-hand side of \(P(k+1)\) and work to the right-hand side:%
\begin{align*}
1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k-1) + (2k+1) ~ \amp = k^2 + (2k+1) \amp \text{by ind. hyp.}\\
\amp = (k+1)^2 \amp \text{by factoring}

Let \(P(n)\) be the statement \(F_0 + F_2 + F_4 + \cdots + F_{2n} = F_{2n+1} - 1\). We will show that \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 0\). First the base case is easy because \(F_0 = 0\) and \(F_1 = 1\) so \(F_0 = F_1 - 1\). Now consider the inductive case. Assume \(P(k)\) is true, that is, assume \(F_0 + F_2 + F_4 + \cdots + F_{2k} = F_{2k+1} - 1\). To establish \(P(k+1)\) we work from left to right:%
\begin{align*}
F_0 + F_2 + \cdots + F_{2k} + F_{2k+2} ~ \amp = F_{2k+1} - 1 + F_{2k+2} \amp \text{by ind. hyp.}\\
\amp = F_{2k+1} + F_{2k+2} - 1 \amp\\
\amp = F_{2k+3} - 1 \amp \text{by recursive def.}
\end{align*}
%
\par
Therefore \(F_0 + F_2 + F_4 + \cdots + F_{2k+2} = F_{2k+3} - 1\), which is to say \(P(k+1)\) holds. Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 0\).%

Let \(P(n)\) be the statement \(2^n \lt  n!\). We will show \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 4\). First, we check the base case and see that yes, \(2^4 \lt  4!\) (as \(16 \lt  24\)) so \(P(4)\) is true. Now for the inductive case. Assume \(P(k)\) is true for an arbitrary \(k \ge 4\). That is, \(2^k \lt  k!\). Now consider \(P(k+1)\): \(2^{k+1} \lt  (k+1)!\). To prove this, we start with the left side and work to the right side.%
\begin{align*}
2^{k+1}~ \amp = 2\cdot 2^k \amp\\
\amp \lt 2\cdot k! \amp \text{by the inductive hypothesis}\\
\amp \lt (k+1) \cdot k! \amp \text{ since } k+1 \gt 2\\
\amp = (k+1)! \amp
\end{align*}
%
\par
Therefore \(2^{k+1} \lt (k+1)!\) so we have established \(P(k+1)\). Thus by the principle of mathematical induction \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 4\).%

Let \(P(n)\) be the statement that \(n + 3 \lt n + 7\). We will prove that \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \in \N\). First, note that the base case holds: \(0+3 \lt 0+7\). Now assume for induction that \(P(k)\) is true. That is, \(k+3 \lt k+7\). We must show that \(P(k+1)\) is true. Now since \(k + 3 \lt k + 7\), add 1 to both sides. This gives \(k + 3 + 1 \lt k + 7 + 1\). Regrouping \((k+1) + 3 \lt (k+1) + 7\). But this is simply \(P(k+1)\). Thus by the principle of mathematical induction \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \in \N\).%

For a valid proof by induction, \(P(k) \imp P(k+1)\) must be true for all values of \(k\) greater than or equal to the base case.%

Let \(P(n)\) be the statement ``\(n\) is either a power of 2 or can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2.'' We will show that \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 1\).%
\par
Base case: \(1 = 2^0\) is a power of 2, so \(P(1)\) is true.%
\par
Inductive case: Suppose \(P(k)\) is true for all \(k \lt n\). Now if \(n\) is a power of 2, we are done. If not, let \(2^x\) be the largest power of 2 strictly less than \(n\). Consider \(n - 2^x\), which is a smaller number, in fact smaller than both \(n\) and \(2^x\). Thus \(n-2^x\) is either a power of 2 or can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2, but none of them are going to be \(2^x\), so the together with \(2^x\) we have written \(n\) as the sum of distinct powers of 2.%

Therefore, by the principle of (strong) mathematical induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 1\).%

\textbf{Solution}.\hypertarget{p:solution:UzL-back}\quad{}The idea here is that if we take the logarithm of \(a^n\), we can increase \(n\) by 1 if we multiply by another \(a\) (inside the logarithm). This results in adding 1 more \(\log(a)\) to the total.%
\begin{proofptx}{}{p:proof:AGU}
Let \(P(n)\) be the statement \(\log(a^n) = n \log(a)\). The base case, \(P(2)\) is true, because \(\log(a^2) = \log(a\cdot a) = \log(a) + \log(a) = 2\log(a)\), by the product rule for logarithms. Now assume, for induction, that \(P(k)\) is true. That is, \(\log(a^k) = k\log(a)\). Consider \(\log(a^{k+1})\). We have%
\begin{equation*}
\log(a^{k+1}) = \log(a^k\cdot a) = \log(a^k) + \log(a) = k\log(a) + \log(a)\text{,}
\end{equation*}
with the last equality due to the inductive hypothesis. But this simplifies to \((k+1) \log(a)\), establishing \(P(k+1)\). Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 2\).%

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.%

\par
A ``Modified Version'' of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and\slash{}or translated into another language.%
\par
A ``Secondary Section'' is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.%
\par
The ``Invariant Sections'' are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.%
\par
The ``Cover Texts'' are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.%
\par
A ``Transparent'' copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not ``Transparent'' is called ``Opaque''.%
\par
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and\slash{}or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.%
\par
The ``Title Page'' means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, ``Title Page'' means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.%

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.%
\par
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.%
\par
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.%
\par
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.%
\end{paragraphs}%
\begin{paragraphs}{4. MODIFICATIONS.}{x:paragraphs:gfdl-section4}%
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item{}Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.%
\item{}List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.%
\item{}State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.%
\item{}Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.%
\item{}Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.%
\item{}Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.%
\item{}Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.%
\item{}Include an unaltered copy of this License.%
\item{}Preserve the section Entitled ``History'', Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled ``History'' in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.%
\item{}Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the ``History'' section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.%
\item{}For any section Entitled ``Acknowledgements'' or ``Dedications'', Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and\slash{}or dedications given therein.%
\item{}Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.%
\item{}Delete any section Entitled ``Endorsements''. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.%
\item{}Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled ``Endorsements'' or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.%
\item{}Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.%
\par
You may add a section Entitled ``Endorsements'', provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties \textemdash{} for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.%
\par
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.%
\par
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.%
\end{paragraphs}%
\begin{paragraphs}{5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS.}{x:paragraphs:gfdl-section5}%
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.%
\par
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.%
\par
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled ``History'' in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled ``History''; likewise combine any sections Entitled ``Acknowledgements'', and any sections Entitled ``Dedications''. You must delete all sections Entitled ``Endorsements''.%
\end{paragraphs}%
\begin{paragraphs}{6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS.}{x:paragraphs:gfdl-section6}%
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.%
\par
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.%
\end{paragraphs}%
\begin{paragraphs}{7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS.}{x:paragraphs:gfdl-section7}%
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an ``aggregate'' if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.%
\par
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.%
\end{paragraphs}%
\begin{paragraphs}{8. TRANSLATION.}{x:paragraphs:gfdl-section8}%
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.%
\par
If a section in the Document is Entitled ``Acknowledgements'', ``Dedications'', or ``History'', the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.%
\end{paragraphs}%
\begin{paragraphs}{9. TERMINATION.}{x:paragraphs:gfdl-section9}%
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.%
\par
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.%
\par
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.%
\par
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.%
\end{paragraphs}%
\begin{paragraphs}{10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE.}{x:paragraphs:gfdl-section10}%
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See \url{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/}.%
\par
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License ``or any later version'' applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.%
\end{paragraphs}%
\begin{paragraphs}{11. RELICENSING.}{x:paragraphs:gfdl-section11}%
``Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site'' (or ``MMC Site'') means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A ``Massive Multiauthor Collaboration'' (or ``MMC'') contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.%
\par
``CC-BY-SA'' means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.%
\par
``Incorporate'' means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.%
\par
An MMC is ``eligible for relicensing'' if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.%
\par
The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.%
