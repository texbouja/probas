This book is a synthesis of three textbooks on discrete mathematics and combinatorics.  First, many of the problems, and indeed entire sections, come directly from \textsl{Combinatorics Through Guided Discovery} by Kenneth P. Bogart.  This is possible thanks to the Bogart estate's decision to release his book under an open license (the GFDL, the same license this text uses).  The format of this book has been made to match that of Bogart's text, with most of the exposition being driven by problems (which we call \emph{activities}) for students to work on.  A copy of Bogart's book can be found for free at \href{http://bogart.openmathbooks.org/}{bogart.openmathbooks.org}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2}{}%
The second source for material is \textsl{Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics} by Richard Grassl.  This is a set of notes used for many years as the textbook for MATH 528 at the University of Northern Colorado.  We have tried to capture the flavor and emphasis of this book, and have used many of its exercises among our \emph{activities}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-3}{}%
For the background material contained in the index, as well as much of the chapter on graph theory, material was borrowed from \textsl{Discrete Mathematics: an Open Introduction}, the book I wrote for the undergraduate discrete course at the University of Northern Colorado.  This book can be found (for free) at \href{http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/}{discrete.openmathbooks.org}.%

\chapter*{Preface}\label{preface}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface}
\hypertarget{p-5}{}%
This book was written specifically to be used as the textbook for the Master's level Discrete Mathematics course at the University of Northern Colorado.  This course is part of a MA in Mathematics with a Teaching Emphasis.  Most of the students in the course are current secondary math teachers.  This intended audience has influenced the style and content of the book in a few important ways.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-6}{}%
First, we acknowledge that not everyone reading this book will be immediately familiar with the content of a standard undergraduate discrete mathematics course.  Little is assumed about the reader's previous work in the subject, beyond a general understanding of how abstract mathematics proceeds, as well as some basic ability with mathematical proof. Even here, the first chapter on Graph Theory serves as an excuse to review basic proof techniques.  For the reader completely unfamiliar with these and the basic objects of mathematical study (sets and functions), background material is included in an Appendix.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-7}{}%
Topics have been selected to illustrate larger concepts of interest to secondary teachers.  We have put an emphasis on understanding simple concepts deeply and in more than one way.  Although some topics intersect secondary curriculum, most of the questions here are at a higher level.  Still, the problem solving strategies and big ideas illustrated by our questions have applications to secondary mathematics.  This emphasis is quite different than other mid level discrete and combinatorics textbooks, since we are not preparing our readers to begin a career in research mathematics.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-8}{}%
While this course is not a course on teaching mathematics, we have tried to model good pedagogical practice.  As you will see, almost all of the textbook consists of ``Activities'' that guide students to discover mathematics for themselves.  This will require quite a bit more work both from students and instructors, but we strongly believe that the best way to learn mathematics is by doing mathematics.  Most of all, discovering mathematics is fun.%

\paragraph[{How to use this book}]{How to use this book}\hypertarget{paragraphs-1}{}
\hypertarget{p-9}{}%
This book is mostly about solving problems, and using those problems and their solutions to develop mathematics and mathematical understanding.  The main three chapters consist of more than 300 \emph{activities} which the reader is asked to complete.  That is how you should use the book.  As you read, when you come to an activity, really take some time to try to solve it.  Many of the activities are broken down into tasks to help guide you to a solution.  If you get stuck, check for a hint.  In the pdf, problems with hints are marked with a small ``[hint]'' link that will take you to the hint in the back of the book; clicking on the number of the hint will return you to the activity.  The online version has expandable hint links under any activities for which they are provided.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-10}{}%
Solutions are not provided explicitly, but often the important content of an activity will be explained further into the book.  We have made every effort to make the problems ``self checking'' so that you do not run the risk of learning something false.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-11}{}%
For the most part, if you are unable to complete an activity, assuming you have put a reasonable effort in already, it would be safe to move on.  If the activity is meant to guide you to a fundamental concept, that will become apparent, and later activities and exposition will help you uncover that concept.  Other activities are meant to provide interesting examples of these big ideas, but missing any one of them will not impede your progress on other activities.%

In the time of Euler, in the town of Königsberg in Prussia, there was a river containing two islands. The islands were connected to the banks of the river by seven bridges (as seen below). The bridges were very beautiful, and on their days off, townspeople would spend time walking over the bridges. As time passed, a question arose: was it possible to plan a walk so that you cross each bridge once and only once? Euler was able to answer this question. Are you?%

Professor Nefario has invited 25 unsuspecting discrete math students to his estate for an evening of escape room fun.  Some of these students are already friends, but no student is friends with more than 3 other students.  The Professor wants to ensure that no friends are sent to the same escape room.  Can he be sure that four escape rooms will be enough?%
\end{investigation}

Is it possible that among the 25 students, everyone has \emph{exactly} three friends?%

\hypertarget{p-16}{}%
Take a regular deck of 52 cards, shuffle well, and deal the cards into 13 piles.  Will it always be possible to select one card from each pile so that the 13 cards you select all have different values (ace, 2, 3, etc.)?%
\end{investigation}
\hypertarget{p-17}{}%
All the puzzles above have a feature in common: they involve the ways in which individual (discrete) objects can be related to each other.  This is what graph theory studies, and we will see that each of the puzzles can be solved with the tools of the subject.  Before we start developing those tools, take a moment to see why graphs are applicable to these problems.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-18}{}%
In the bridges of Königsberg puzzle, all that really matters is which land masses are connected by bridges, and how many bridges connect them.  The length of the bridges and size of the land masses is unimportant.  So we can represent this puzzle with a graph like this:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0.375}{0.375}{0}
\begin{sbspanel}{0.25}
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{{
          \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.9, yscale=.5]
\draw (-1,-2) \v to [out=120, in=240] (-1,0) \v to [out=120, in=240] (-1,2) \v to [out=300, in=60] (-1,0) to [out=300, in=60] (-1,-2);
\draw (1,0) \v -- (-1,2) (-1,0) -- (1,0) -- (-1,-2);
\end{tikzpicture}
}
}
\end{sbspanel}
\end{sidebyside}
\par
\hypertarget{p-19}{}%
Now we must decide whether it is possible to travel around that graph in a way that each edge is crossed exactly once.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-20}{}%
When it comes to friendship, if we assume that it is always reciprocated, we can represent the people as vertices and connect two vertices with an edge if the people they represent are friends.  We can ask whether it is possible to have such a graph in which each vertex is incident to exactly three edges or whether it is possible to ``color'' the vertices with just four colors so that no pair of same colored vertices are adjacent (connected by an edge).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-21}{}%
If we have thirteen piles of cards, we represent each pile as a vertex and each value as a vertex, and connect a pile vertex to a value vertex precisely when that value is in the pile.  We could then ask whether we could select a collection of thirteen edges that do not share any single vertex.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-22}{}%
These puzzles give you just a small glimpse into the myriad of applications graph theory can address.  For us, we will use our study of graph theory to see how reasoning in discrete mathematics works and as an excuse to remind ourselves of the basic mathematical objects and proof techniques required to study the subject in general.%

You might also think of a graph as a set of vertices and a set of edges, where each edge is a set of two vertices. Are the graphs below the same or different? \leavevmode%

\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-31}{}%
Before we start studying graphs, we need to agree upon what a graph is.  		While we almost always think of graphs as pictures (dots connected by lines) this is fairly ambiguous.  Do the lines need to be straight?  Does it matter how long the lines are or how large the dots are?  Can there be two lines connecting the same pair of dots?  Can one line connect three dots?%
\par
\hypertarget{p-32}{}%
The way we avoid ambiguities in mathematics is to provide concrete and rigorous \emph{definitions}.  Crafting good definitions is not easy, but it is incredibly important.  The definition is the agreed upon starting point from which all truths in mathematics proceed.  Is there a graph with no edges?  We have to look at the definition to see if this is possible.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-33}{}%
We want our definition to be precise and unambiguous, but it also must agree with our intuition for the objects we are studying.  It needs to be useful: we \emph{could} define a graph to be a six legged mammal, but that would not let us solve any problems about bridges.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-3}
\hypertarget{p-34}{}%
Write a definition for a \emph{graph}.  Make sure that your definition can be helpful in making sense of \hyperref[activity-graphdiff]{Activity~\ref{activity-graphdiff}}.%
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-35}{}%
Writing definitions is hard.  You should compare what you came up with to the following:%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-1}
\hypertarget{p-36}{}%
A \terminology{graph} is an ordered pair \(G = (V, E)\) consisting of a nonempty set \(V\) (called the \terminology{vertices}) and a set \(E\) (called the \terminology{edges}) of two-element subsets of \(V\).%
\end{definition}
\hypertarget{p-37}{}%
Strange.  Nowhere in the definition is there talk of dots or lines.  From the definition, a graph could be%
\begin{equation*}
(\{a,b,c,d\}, \{\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{b,d\}, \{c,d\}\}).
\end{equation*}
Here we have a graph with four vertices  (the letters \(a, b, c, d\)) and four edges (the pairs \(\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{b,d\}, \{c,d\})\)).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-38}{}%
Looking at sets and sets of 2-element sets is difficult to process.  That is why we often draw a representation of these sets.  We put a dot down for each vertex, and connect two dots with a line precisely when those two vertices are one of the 2-element subsets in our set of edges.  Thus one way to draw the graph described above is this:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0.375}{0.375}{0}
\begin{sbspanel}{0.25}
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{{
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.7]
   \draw  (-1,1) \vl{\(a\)} -- (1,1) \vr{\(b\)} (-1,1) -- (-1,-1) \vl{\(c\)} -- (1,-1) \vr{\(d\)} -- (1,1) -- (-1,-1);
 \end{tikzpicture}
}
}
\end{sbspanel}
\end{sidebyside}
\par
\hypertarget{p-39}{}%
However we could also have drawn the graph differently. For example either of these:%
\begin{sidebyside}{2}{0.1375}{0.1375}{0.275}
\begin{sbspanel}{0.2}[bottom]

We should be careful about what it means for two graphs to be ``the same.''  Actually, given our definition, this is easy: Are the vertex sets equal?  Are the edge sets equal?  We know what it means for sets to be equal, and graphs are nothing but a pair of two special sorts of sets.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-1}
\hypertarget{p-41}{}%
Are the graphs below equal?%
\begin{equation*}
G_1 = (\{a,b,c\}, \{\{a,b\}, \{b,c\}\}); \qquad G_2 = (\{a,b,c\}, \{\{a,c\}, \{c, b\}\})
\end{equation*}
equal?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-1}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-42}{}%
No.  Here the vertex sets of each graph are equal, which is a good start.  Also, both graphs have two edges.  In the first graph, we have edges \(\{a,b\}\) and \(\{b,c\}\), while in the second graph we have edges	\(\{a,c\}\) and 	\(\{c,b\}\).  Now we do have \(\{b,c\} = \{c,b\}\), so that is not the problem.  The issue is that \(\{a,b\} \ne \{a,c\}\).  Since the edge sets of the two graphs are not equal (as sets), the graphs are not equal (as graphs).%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-43}{}%
Even if two graphs are not \emph{equal}, they might be \emph{basically} the same. The graphs in the previous example could be drawn like this:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0.2}{0.2}{0}

Graphs that are basically the same (but perhaps not equal) are called \terminology{isomorphic}. We will give a precise definition of this term after a quick example:%

Are these graphs the same?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-2}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-49}{}%
The two graphs are NOT equal. It is enough to notice that \(V_1 \ne V_2\) since \(a \in V_1\) but \(a \notin V_2\). However, both of these graphs consist of three vertices with edges connecting every pair of vertices. We can draw them as follows:%
\begin{sidebyside}{2}{0.125}{0.125}{0.25}
\begin{sbspanel}{0.25}[bottom]

\hypertarget{p-50}{}%
Clearly we want to say these graphs are basically the same, so while they are not equal, they will be \emph{isomorphic}. The reason is we can rename the vertices of one graph and get the second graph as the result.%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-51}{}%
Intuitively, graphs are \terminology{isomorphic} \index{isomorphic} if they are basically the same, or better yet, if they are the same except for the names of the vertices. To make the concept of renaming vertices precise, we give the following definitions:%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-2}
\hypertarget{p-52}{}%
\index{isomorphic} An \terminology{isomorphism}\index{isomorphism} between two graphs \(G_1\) and \(G_2\) is a bijection \(f:V_1 \to V_2\) between the vertices of the graphs such that \(\{a,b\}\) is an edge in \(G_1\) if and only if \(\{f(a), f(b)\}\) is an edge in \(G_2\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-53}{}%
Two graphs are \terminology{isomorphic} if there is an isomorphism between them. In this case we write \(G_1 \isom G_2\).%
\end{definition}
\hypertarget{p-54}{}%
An isomorphism is simply a function which renames the vertices. It must be a bijection so every vertex gets a new name. These newly named vertices must be connected by edges precisely if they were connected by edges with their old names.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-3}
\hypertarget{p-55}{}%
Decide whether the graphs \(G_1 = \{V_1, E_1\}\) and \(G_2 = \{V_2, E_2\}\) are equal or isomorphic.%

\par
\hypertarget{p-57}{}%
\(V_2 = \{a,b,c,d\}\), \(E_2 = \{\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{c,d\}\}\)%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-3}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-58}{}%
The graphs are NOT equal, since \(\{a,d\} \in E_1\) but \(\{a,d\} \notin E_2\). However, since both graphs contain the same number of vertices and same number of edges, they \emph{might} be isomorphic (this is not enough in most cases, but it is a good start).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-59}{}%
We can try to build an isomorphism. How about we say \(f(a) = b\), \(f(b) = c\), \(f(c) = d\) and \(f(d) = a\). This is definitely a bijection, but to make sure that the function is an isomorphism, we must make sure it \emph{respects the edge relation}. In \(G_1\), vertices \(a\) and \(b\) are connected by an edge. In \(G_2\), \(f(a) = b\) and \(f(b) = c\) are connected by an edge. So far, so good, but we must check the other three edges. The edge \(\{a,c\}\) in \(G_1\) corresponds to \(\{f(a), f(c)\} = \{b,d\}\), but here we have a problem. There is no edge between \(b\) and \(d\) in \(G_2\). Thus \(f\) is NOT an isomorphism.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-60}{}%
Not all hope is lost, however. Just because \(f\) is not an isomorphism does not mean that there is no isomorphism at all. We can try again. At this point it might be helpful to draw the graphs to see how they should match up.%

Alternatively, notice that in \(G_1\), the vertex \(a\) is adjacent to every other vertex. In \(G_2\), there is also a vertex with this property: \(c\). So build the bijection \(g:V_1 \to V_2\) by defining \(g(a) = c\) to start with. Next, where should we send \(b\)? In \(G_1\), the vertex \(b\) is only adjacent to vertex \(a\). There is exactly one vertex like this in \(G_2\), namely \(d\). So let \(g(b) = d\). As for the last two, in this example, we have a free choice: let \(g(c) = b\) and \(g(d) = a\) (switching these would be fine as well).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-62}{}%
We should check that this really is an isomorphism. It is definitely a bijection. We must make sure that the edges are respected. The four edges in \(G_1\) are%
\begin{equation*}
\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{a,d\}, \{c,d\}
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-63}{}%
Under the proposed isomorphism these become%
\begin{equation*}
\{g(a), g(b)\}, \{g(a), g(c)\}, \{g(a), g(d)\}, \{g(c), g(d)\}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
\{c,d\}, \{c,b\}, \{c,a\}, \{b,a\}
\end{equation*}
which are precisely the edges in \(G_2\). Thus \(g\) is an isomorphism, so \(G_1 \cong G_2\)%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-64}{}%
Sometimes we will talk about a graph with a special name (like \(K_n\) or the \emph{Peterson graph}) or perhaps draw a graph without any labels. In this case we are really referring to \emph{all} graphs isomorphic to any copy of that particular graph. A collection of isomorphic graphs is often called an \terminology{isomorphism class}\index{isomorphism class}.\footnote{This is not unlike geometry, where we might have more than one copy of a particular triangle. There instead of \emph{isomorphic} we say \emph{congruent}.\label{fn-1}}%

We would like to say that the smaller graph is a \emph{subgraph} of the larger.%

We should give a careful definition of this.  In fact, there are two reasonable notions for what a subgroup should mean.%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{definition-3}
\hypertarget{p-85}{}%
We say that \(G' = (V', E')\) is a \terminology{subgraph}\index{subgraph} of \(G = (V, E)\), and write \(G' \subseteq G\), provided \(V' \subseteq V\) and \(E' \subseteq E\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-86}{}%
We say that \(G' = (V', E')\) is an \terminology{induced subgraph}\index{subgraph!induced}\index{induced subgraph} of \(G = (V, E)\) provided \(V' \subseteq V\) and every edge in \(E\) whose vertices are still in \(V'\) is also an edge in \(E'\).%
\end{definition}
\hypertarget{p-87}{}%
Notice that every induced subgraph is also an ordinary subgraph, but not conversely.  Think of a subgraph as the result of deleting some vertices and edges from the larger graph.  For the subgraph to be an induced subgraph, we can still delete vertices, but now we only delete those edges that included the deleted vertices.%

Here both \(G_2\) and \(G_3\) are subgraphs of \(G_1\).  But only \(G_2\) is an \emph{induced} subgraph.  Every edge in \(G_1\) that connects vertices in \(G_2\) is also an edge in \(G_2\).  In \(G_3\), the edge \(\{a,b\}\) is in \(E_1\) but not \(E_3\), even though vertices \(a\) and \(b\) are in \(V_3\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-90}{}%
The graph \(G_4\) is NOT a subgraph of \(G_1\), even though it looks like all we did is remove vertex \(e\).  The reason is that in \(E_4\) we have the edge \(\{c,f\}\) but this is not an element of \(E_1\), so we don't have the required 	\(E_4 \subseteq E_1\).%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-91}{}%
Back to some basic graph theory definitions. Notice that all the graphs we have drawn above have the property that no pair of vertices is connected more than once, and no vertex is connected to itself. Graphs like these are sometimes called \terminology{simple}, although we will just call them \emph{graphs}. This is because our definition for a graph says that the edges form a set of 2-element subsets of the vertices. Remember that it doesn't make sense to say a set contains an element more than once. So no pair of vertices can be connected by an edge more than once. Also, since each edge must be a set containing two vertices, we cannot have a single vertex connected to itself by an edge.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-92}{}%
That said, there are times we want to consider double (or more) edges and single edge loops. For example, the ``graph'' we drew for the Bridges of Königsberg problem had double edges because there really are two bridges connecting a particular island to the near shore. We will call these objects \terminology{multigraphs}\index{multigraph}. This is a good name: a \emph{multiset} is a set in which we are allowed to include a single element multiple times.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-93}{}%
The graphs above are also \terminology{connected}\index{connected}: you can get from any vertex to any other vertex by following some path of edges. A graph that is not connected can be thought of as two separate graphs drawn close together. For example, the following graph is NOT connected because there is no path from \(a\) to \(b\):%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0.335}{0.335}{0}
\begin{sbspanel}{0.33}
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{{
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\draw (-1.5,0) \vl{\footnotesize $a$} -- (-.5, 1) \v -- (.5, 0) \v -- (-.5,-1) \v -- cycle;
	\draw (-.5,0) \v -- (.5,1) \v -- (1.5,0) \vr{\footnotesize $b$} -- (.5,-1) \v -- cycle;
\end{tikzpicture}
}
}
\end{sbspanel}
\end{sidebyside}
\par
\hypertarget{p-94}{}%
Most of the time, it makes sense to treat non-connected graphs as separate graphs (think of the above graph as two squares), so unless otherwise stated, we will assume all our graphs are connected.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-95}{}%
Vertices in a graph do not always have edges between them. If we add all possible edges, then the resulting graph is called \terminology{complete}\index{complete graph}. That is, a graph is complete if every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. Since a graph is determined completely by which vertices are adjacent to which other vertices, there is only one complete graph with a given number of vertices. We give these a special name: \(K_n\)\label{notation-1}
 is the complete graph on \(n\) vertices.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-96}{}%
Each vertex in \(K_n\) is adjacent to \(n-1\) other vertices. We call the number of edges emanating from a given vertex the \terminology{degree} of that vertex. So every vertex in \(K_n\) has degree \(n-1\). How many edges does \(K_n\) have? One might think the answer should be \(n(n-1)\), since we count \(n-1\) edges \(n\) times (once for each vertex). However, each edge is incident to 2 vertices, so we counted every edge exactly twice. Thus there are \(n(n-1)/2\) edges in \(K_n\). %
\par
\hypertarget{p-97}{}%
In general, if we know the degrees of all the vertices in a graph, we can find the number of edges. The sum of the degrees of all vertices will always be \emph{twice} the number of edges, since each edge adds to the degree of two vertices. Notice this means that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in any graph must be even!%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-5}
\hypertarget{p-98}{}%
At a recent math seminar, 9 mathematicians greeted each other by shaking hands. Is it possible that each mathematician shook hands with exactly 7 people at the seminar?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-8}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-99}{}%
It seems like this should be possible. Each mathematician chooses one person to not shake hands with. But this cannot happen. We are asking whether a graph with 9 vertices can have each vertex have degree 7. If such a graph existed, the sum of the degrees of the vertices would be \(9\cdot 7 = 63\). This would be twice the number of edges (handshakes) resulting in a graph with \(31.5\) edges. That is impossible. Thus at least one (in fact an odd number) of the mathematicians must have shaken hands with an \emph{even} number of people at the seminar.%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-100}{}%
One final definition: we say a graph is \terminology{bipartite}\index{bipartite} if the vertices can be divided into two sets, \(A\) and \(B\), with no two vertices in \(A\) adjacent and no two vertices in \(B\) adjacent. The vertices in \(A\) can be adjacent to some or all of the vertices in \(B\). If each vertex in \(A\) is adjacent to all the vertices in \(B\), then the graph is a \terminology{complete bipartite graph}, and gets a special name: \(K_{m,n}\), where \(|A| = m\) and \(|B| = n\). The graph in the houses and utilities puzzle is \(K_{3,3}\).%

How might you use graph theory to solve the puzzle above?  One thing to try would be to create a graph consisting of six vertices, one for each value that appears on the dominoes.  Then connect the vertices if their numbers belong to the same domino.  This seems reasonable, but then how would you represent the line of matched up dominoes the puzzle requests?%
\par
\hypertarget{p-128}{}%
Say you start with domino \((4,6)\).  That is an edge in our graph.  Next we need to place a domino with a 6 on it (or a 4, but let's say the 4 will be an endpoint).  This amounts to selecting another edge, one that is incident to the vertex 6.  Say we pick \((6,5)\).  The edge we must select after that will need to be incident to vertex 5.  And so on.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-129}{}%
The edges we select in the graph need to be linked up.  It makes sense to think about the selection of edges as traveling through the graph, moving along edges from vertex to vertex.  Let's capture this notion carefully.%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{def-walk}
\index{walk}\index{trail}\index{path}\index{circuit}\index{cycle}\hypertarget{p-130}{}%
A \terminology{walk} in a graph \(G = (V,E)\) is a sequence of vertices \(v_0, v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\) such that \(\{v_i, v_{i+1}\} \in E\) for all \(0 \le i \lt n\).  That is, consecutive vertices in the sequence are adjacent in the graph.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-131}{}%
A \terminology{trail} is a walk that does not repeat any edges.  If the trail starts and ends at the same vertex (i.e., \(v_1 = v_n\)) then it is called a \terminology{circuit}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-132}{}%
A \terminology{path} is a trail that does not repeat any vertices, except perhaps for \(v_0 = v_n\).  In the case that \(v_0 = v_n\), the path is called a \terminology{cycle}.%
\end{definition}
\hypertarget{p-133}{}%
Do these definitions capture what a walk/trail/path should mean in a graph?  All three of these describe ways in which to move around in the graph, perhaps tracing along the edges without lifting up your pencil.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-134}{}%
Note: some sources give slightly different definitions for these concepts.  For example, sometimes a walk is defined as a alternating sequence of vertices and edges \(v_1e_1v_2e_2v_3\cdots e_{n-1}v_n\) with the requirement that \(v_i\) is incident to \(e_i\), which is incident to \(v_{i+1}\).  We have not named our edges, so this definition would not make sense.  Another common way to define \emph{path} is as a subgraph isomorphic to \(P_n\) for some \(n\).  This is almost equivalent to our definition, except that we allow our paths to possibly be isomorphic to \(C_n\) for some \(n\) as well.  Some sources use \emph{path} where we use \emph{walk} and use \emph{simple path} where we use \emph{path}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-135}{}%
Walks and paths are useful for considering all sorts of graph theoretic concepts.  For example, you might want to find the \terminology{distance} between two vertices.  This would be defined as the shortest path starting at one and ending at the other (where the \terminology{length} of a path is the number of edges in it).  If you have a notion of distance, you can define the \emph{center} and \emph{radius} of a graph.  Graphs are \emph{connected} provided between any two vertices, there is a path (or equivalently, a walk).%

To solve the domino problem, as well as the Bridges of Königsberg, we need to consider walks that use every edge exactly once.%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{def-eulerpath}
\hypertarget{p-137}{}%
A walk in a graph that uses every edge exactly once is called an \terminology{Euler path}.  An Euler path that starts and ends at the same vertex is called an \terminology{Euler circuit}.%
\end{definition}
\hypertarget{p-138}{}%
Although it is tradition, \emph{Euler path} is a bad name.  These should be called an \terminology{Euler trail} or \terminology{Euler walk}, since by our definitions, an Euler path is usually not a path at all.  An Euler circuit is also sometimes called an \terminology{Euler tour}.%

This graph is small enough that we could actually check every possible walk that does not reuse edges, and in doing so convince ourselves that there is no Euler path (let alone an Euler circuit). On small graphs which do have an Euler path, it is usually not difficult to find one. Our goal is to find a quick way to check whether a graph has an Euler path or circuit, even if the graph is quite large.%
\par

One way to guarantee that a graph does \emph{not} have an Euler circuit is to include a ``spike,'' a vertex of degree 1.%

The vertex \(a\) has degree 1, and if you try to make an Euler circuit, you see that you will get stuck at the vertex. It is a dead end. That is, unless you start there. But then there is no way to return, so there is no hope of finding an Euler circuit. There is however an Euler path. It starts at the vertex \(a\), then loops around the triangle. You will end at the vertex of degree 3.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-150}{}%
You run into a similar problem whenever you have a vertex of any odd degree. If you start at such a vertex, you will not be able to end there (after traversing every edge exactly once). After using one edge to leave the starting vertex, you will be left with an even number of edges emanating from the vertex. Half of these could be used for returning to the vertex, the other half for leaving. So you return, then leave. Return, then leave. The only way to use up all the edges is to use the last one by leaving the vertex. On the other hand, if you have a vertex with odd degree that you do not start a path at, then you will eventually get stuck at that vertex. The path will use pairs of edges incident to the vertex to arrive and leave again. Eventually all but one of these edges will be used up, leaving only an edge to arrive by, and none to leave again.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-151}{}%
What all this says is that if a graph has an Euler path and two vertices with odd degree, then the Euler path must start at one of the odd degree vertices and end at the other. In such a situation, every other vertex \emph{must} have an even degree since we need an equal number of edges to get to those vertices as to leave them. How could we have an Euler circuit? The graph could not have any odd degree vertex as an Euler path would have to start there or end there, but not both. Thus for a graph to have an Euler circuit, all vertices must have even degree.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-152}{}%
So there is clearly a connection between the parity of vertex degrees and Euler paths and circuits.  Here are two theorems the describe that connection.%
\begin{theorem}[{}]\label{thm-eulercircuit}
\hypertarget{p-153}{}%
A connected graph has an Euler circuit if and only if the degree of every vertex is even.%
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}[{}]\label{thm-eulerpath}
\hypertarget{p-154}{}%
A connected graph has an Euler path if and only if there are at most two vertices with odd degree.%
\end{theorem}
\hypertarget{p-155}{}%
We will need to prove these theorems, and doing so will give us an excuse to think about proving theorems in general.  However, note that these theorems answer the bridges of Königsberg problem.  The graph has all four vertices with odd degree, there is no Euler path through the graph.  Thus there is no way for the townspeople to cross every bridge exactly once.%

\subsection[{Interlude: Implications and Proofs}]{Interlude: Implications and Proofs}\label{subsection-2}
\hypertarget{p-156}{}%
We would like to prove the theorems we conjectured above about Euler paths and circuits.  To help us understand how we could do this, and to make sure our proof is correct, we should take a few moments to recall some basic facts about mathematical statements, their logical form, and how this can help us in writing proofs.  A more detailed discussion of these topics is found in \hyperref[sec_background-logic]{Sections~\ref{sec_background-logic}} and \hyperref[sec_background-proofs]{Section~\ref{sec_background-proofs}}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-157}{}%
All mathematical statements have a \emph{logical form} that determines the meaning of the statement and often suggests a method for proving (or disproving) the statement.  At the most basic level, a statement might be \terminology{atomic}, if it is not composed of simpler statements, or otherwise \terminology{molecular}.  A molecular statement is built up of smaller statements by connecting them with a \terminology{logical connective}. Such statements might be a \terminology{conjunction} (two statements connected by an ``and'') a \terminology{disjunction} (two statements connected by an ``or''), an \terminology{implication} or \terminology{conditional} (usually in the form ``if \textellipsis{} then \textellipsis{}''), or a \terminology{negation} (claiming a statement is \emph{not} true).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-158}{}%
There are other logical connectives, used both in mathematical statements and in ordinary language, but every one can be reduced to these four (actually, you can get away with as few as two of them).   For example, it is very common in mathematics to encounter statements of the form ``\(P\) if and only if \(Q\).''  This is called a \terminology{biconditional}, but it is nothing more than the conjunction of two implications.  That is, ``\(P\) if and only if \(Q\)'' means ``if \(P\) then \(Q\), and if \(Q\) then \(P\).''%
\par
\hypertarget{p-159}{}%
The truth of falsity of a molecular statement is determined entirely by the truth or falsity of its parts, governed by set rules of the connectives.  These rules can be communicated through \terminology{truth tables}.  We use the standard symbols \(\wedge\) for ``and'', \(\vee\) for ``or'', \(\imp\) for implications and \(\neg\) for negations.%

Note that the truth table for \(P \vee Q\) shows us that we always mean the \emph{inclusive or}, in that when both \(P\) and \(Q\) are true, we say that \(P \vee Q\) is true.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-161}{}%
The other truth table worth looking closely at is the one for implications.  This might strike you as strange at first.  If \(P\) is false, the implication \(P \imp Q\) is true (no matter the truth value of \(Q\)).  Also, there is no need for \(P\) to ``cause'' \(Q\) to be true.  For example, the statement ``If 2 is even, then 2 is prime'' is true, despite there being no connection between the concepts of ``even'' and ``prime''.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-7}
\hypertarget{p-162}{}%
Decide which of the statements below are true and which are false.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]

\item\label{task-12} \hypertarget{p-166}{}%

\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-167}{}%
Examining the truth table for \(P \imp Q\) further, we notice that it is possible for \(P \imp Q\) to be true but \(Q \imp P\) to be false. (What would the truth values of \(P\) and \(Q\) need to be to make this the case?) We call \(Q \imp P\) the \terminology{converse} of \(P \imp Q\).%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-8}
\hypertarget{p-168}{}%
Give three examples of implications which are true whose converse is false.  Then give three examples of implications which are true whose converse is true.%

\hypertarget{p-170}{}%
The claim \(P\) if and only if \(Q\) is the claim that both an implication and its converse are true.  This is the form that \hyperref[thm-eulercircuit]{Theorems~\ref{thm-eulercircuit}} and \hyperref[thm-eulerpath]{Theorem~\ref{thm-eulerpath}} about Euler circuits and paths take.  Looking at the form, we see what it would take to prove them.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-171}{}%
To prove a biconditional, you simply must prove both implications (the implication and its converse).  How do you prove an implication though?  Well, by looking at the truth table, we see that we must prove that we are always in rows 1, 3, or 4.  The only case we need to exclude is the one where \(P\) is true and \(Q\) is false.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-172}{}%
So assume \(P\) is true (the other case is automatic).  Under this assumption, we argue that \(Q\) is true as well.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-173}{}%
Alternatively, we could start by assuming \(Q\) is false.  If we can then conclude that \(P\) is also false, we have excluded the one suspect case, as we can conclude that \(P \imp Q\).  You could also conclude that \(\neg Q \imp \neg P\), which is the \terminology{contrapositive} of \(P \imp Q\).  By comparing truth tables, it is easy to see that any implication is equivalent to its contrapositive, so proving a contrapositive is equivalent to proving its implication.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-174}{}%
There is one important piece we should mention here: the use of quantifiers.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-9}
\hypertarget{p-175}{}%
Is it possible for both a statement and its converse to be false?  What could you say about \(P\) and \(Q\) for such a statement?%
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-176}{}%
What about the statement, ``if \(p\) is prime, then \(p\) is odd''.  This statement is false.  So is its converse.  But the truth tables for \(P \imp Q\) and \(Q \imp P\) do not have a false in the same row.  So what is going on?%
\par
\hypertarget{p-177}{}%
The key is that we are secretly adding a \terminology{universal quantifier} in front of statements like this.  What we really mean is that \emph{for all \(p\)}, if \(p\) is prime, then \(p\) is odd.  This is false, because \emph{there exists} (the \terminology{existential quantifier}) some counterexample.  The converse of the statement is, for all \(p\), if \(p\) is odd, then \(p\) is prime.  This is also false, because there exists a counterexample.  Necessarily, it will be a different counterexample than the one that proved the implication was false.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-178}{}%
How do you prove a universally quantified statement is true?  You must prove the implication is true \emph{for all} cases.  To prove that for all \(n\), if \(n^2\) is even, then so is \(n\), you must prove this for \(n = 1\), \(n = 2\), \(n =3\), etc.  But to get on with your life, you might as well prove it for all of them at once.  Let \(n\) be an arbitrary integer.  Now prove the statement for that arbitrary \(n\).  In this case, you might want to assume \(n\) is NOT even and prove that \(n^2\) is not even, to give a proof by contrapositive.  But since \(n\) was arbitrary, you have shown that your poof would work for \emph{any} value of \(n\).%

The other direction is harder.  If you know every vertex has even degree, you must now show there is an Euler circuit.  One thing you could do is to give a procedure for building one.

Suppose you wanted to tour Königsberg in such a way where you visit each land mass (the two islands and both banks) exactly once. This can be done. In graph theory terms, we are asking whether there is a path which visits every vertex exactly once. Such a path is called a \terminology{Hamilton path} (or \terminology{Hamiltonian path})\index{Hamilton path}.  We could also consider \terminology{Hamilton cycles}, which are Hamilton paths which start and stop at the same vertex.%

The graph on the right does not have a Hamilton path.  You would need to visit each of the ``outside'' vertices, but as soon as you visit one, you get stuck.  Note that this graph does not have an Euler path, although there are graphs with Euler paths but no Hamilton paths.%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-203}{}%
It appears that finding Hamilton paths would be easier because graphs often have more edges than vertices, so there are fewer requirements to be met. However, nobody knows whether this is true. There is no known simple test for whether a graph has a Hamilton path. For small graphs this is not a problem, but as the size of the graph grows, it gets harder and harder to check whether there is a Hamilton path. In fact, this is an example of a question which as far as we know is too difficult for computers to solve; it is an example of a problem which is NP-complete\index{NP-complete}.%

When a connected graph can be drawn without any edges crossing, it is called \terminology{planar}. When a planar graph is drawn in this way, it divides the plane into regions called \terminology{faces}.%

When is it possible to draw a graph so that none of the edges cross? If this \emph{is} possible, we say the graph is \terminology{planar}\index{planar} (since you can draw it on the \emph{plane}).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-219}{}%
Notice that the definition of planar includes the phrase ``it is possible to.'' This means that even if a graph does not look like it is planar, it still might be. Perhaps you can redraw it in a way in which no edges cross. For example, this is a planar graph:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0.4}{0.4}{0}
\begin{sbspanel}{0.2}
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{{
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.7, xscale=1.5]

That is because we can redraw it like this:%

\end{sbspanel}
\end{sidebyside}
\par
\hypertarget{p-221}{}%
The graphs are the same, so if one is planar, the other must be too. However, the original drawing of the graph was not a \terminology{planar representation} of the graph.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-222}{}%
When a planar graph is drawn without edges crossing, the edges and vertices of the graph divide the plane into regions. We will call each region a \terminology{face}\index{faces}. The graph above has 3 faces (yes, we \emph{do} include the ``outside'' region as a face). The number of faces does not change no matter how you draw the graph (as long as you do so without the edges crossing), so it makes sense to ascribe the number of faces as a property of the planar graph.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-223}{}%
WARNING: you can only count faces when the graph is drawn in a planar way. For example, consider these two representations of the same graph:%
\begin{sidebyside}{2}{0.1375}{0.1375}{0.275}

If you try to count faces using the graph on the left, you might say there are 5 faces (including the outside). But drawing the graph with a planar representation shows that in fact there are only 4 faces.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-225}{}%
Is there a connection between the number of vertices (\(v\)), the number of edges (\(e\)) and the number of faces (\(f\)) in any connected planar graph?  Let's investigate this.  For each planar graph, we can associate a triple \((v,e,f)\) containing the number of vertices, edges and faces.  For example, the triple for \(K_4\) drawn above is \((4,6,4)\).%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-15}
\hypertarget{p-226}{}%
Draw a lot of planar graphs and for each record the triple \((v,e,f)\).  What triples are possible? Is there a graph with the triple \((5, 9, 6)\)?  What about \((5,7,5)\)?%
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-227}{}%
If we want to understand the relationship between the number of vertices, edges and faces of a planar graph, we could first try to decide which triples can be realized by a graph and which cannot.  At first this might seem like a daunting task.  The key is to think of it recursively.  Perhaps start with simple graphs and build up to more complicated ones.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-16}
\hypertarget{p-228}{}%
What happens to the triple \((v,e,f)\) when you add an edge to a graph?%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-22} \hypertarget{p-229}{}%
Start with a single pair of adjacent vertices (that is, the graph \(P_1\)).  What is \((v,e,f)\)?  What happens to the triple if you extend the path to \(P_2\)?  How do \(v\), \(e\), and \(f\) change?%
\item\label{task-23} \hypertarget{p-230}{}%
You could add another vertex and edge to \(P_2\) (which would either give \(P_3\) or a \emph{star} graph), or you could add an edge connecting two vertices not already adjacent.  What would these two operations do to \((v,e,f)\)?%
\item\label{task-24} \hypertarget{p-231}{}%
Generalize.  Say you know a specific triple \((a,b,c)\) describes a graph \(G\).  Give two new triples that also describe some graphs, each with one more edge than \(G\).%
\item\label{task-25} \hypertarget{p-232}{}%
Conjecture a relationship between \(v\), \(e\), and \(f\) that should hold for any connected planar graph.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-233}{}%
It appears that whenever \((v,e,f)\) describes some graph, then there is a graph with triple \((v+1, e+1, f)\) and a graph with triple \((v,e+1, f+1)\).  Perhaps there are other ways we could add an edge we haven't thought of yet, but so far it seems like this completely describes how any triple must be created.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-234}{}%
If this is the case, what could we conclude?  Every time we add an edge, either the number of vertices or the number of faces increases by 1.  Perhaps then \(e = v + f\)?  But this is not true, since for \(P_1\) we would have \(1 = 2 + 1\), clearly false.  Okay, at least we might guess \(v + f - e\) is constant.  And from \(P_1\), we see that constant would need to be \(2 + 1 - 1 = 2\).  This leads us to conjecture the following theorem.%
\begin{theorem}[{}]\label{thm-eulerformula}
\hypertarget{p-235}{}%

We will soon see that this really is a theorem.  The equation \(v-e+f = 2\) is called \terminology{Euler's formula for planar graphs}.  To prove this, we will want to somehow capture the idea of building up more complicated graphs from simpler ones.  That is a job for mathematical induction!%

We often wish to prove a statement is true for all natural numbers \(n\) (or all integers larger than some smallest example).  Mathematical induction uses the fact that the (infinitely many) cases we wish to prove are in a nice order with a least element.  To show that \(6^n\) has units digit 6 for all \(n \ge 1\), we notice that \(6^n = 6^{n-1}\cdot 6\).  Assuming that we have already shown that \(6^{n-1}\) has units digit 6, we can multiply this number by 6, and note that the units digit will still be a 6, since the units digit of \(x \cdot 6\) is just 6 times the units digit of \(x\), and \(6\cdot 6\) has units digit 6.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-242}{}%
But this seems sneaky.  Is it valid to assume that we already know the units digit of \(6^{n-1}\)?  That is the power of induction.%

\begin{equation*}
\forall k \,(P(k) \imp P(k+1)).

Can we conclude \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n\)?  Well take any \(n\).  For example, \(n = 3\).  We know \(P(0)\) is true, and the implication \(P(0) \imp P(1)\) is true, so we can conclude \(P(1)\).  From \(P(1)\) and \(P(1) \imp P(2)\), we can conclude \(P(2)\).  From \(P(2)\) and \(P(2) \imp P(3)\), we can conclude \(P(3)\).  If we wanted a different value of \(n\), we would just need to keep going until we got up to it.  Since every value of \(n\) can be reached by some finite number of steps starting at 0, we will know, for each \(n\) that \(P(n)\) is true.%

The above discussion is meant to explain why it is reasonable to believe that induction is a valid proof technique.\footnote{Technically, induction must be assumed as an axiom or deduced from the equivalent well-ordering principle which says that every subset of \(\N\) contains a least element; our justification for it is circular, since to prove the justification is valid would be done by induction itself.\label{fn-2}}  Once we believe induction works, we can just use it.  That means just proving two things: \(P(0)\) and for all \(n \ge 0\), \(P(n) \imp P(n+1)\).  We call \(P(0)\) the \terminology{base case} and the implication the \terminology{inductive case}.  Here is an example of what a proof by induction looks like.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-7}
\hypertarget{p-246}{}%
Prove by induction that for all \(n \ge 0\), the number \(n^2 + n\) is even.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-18}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-247}{}%
First note that induction is NOT necessary here.  We could give a non-inductive prove as follows.%
\begin{proof}\hypertarget{proof-1}{}
\hypertarget{p-248}{}%
Fix \(n \ge 0\).  Now \(n^2 + n = n(n+1)\).  Either \(n\) or \((n+1)\) is even, and the product of an even number and an odd number is even, so \(n^2 + n\) is even.%
\end{proof}
\hypertarget{p-249}{}%
To contrast, here is a proof by induction.%
\begin{proof}\hypertarget{proof-2}{}
\hypertarget{p-250}{}%
First note that \(0^2 + 0 = 0\) is even, so the case when \(n = 0\) is true.  Now assume for an arbitrary \(n\ge 0\) that \(n^2 + n\) is even.  Consider the case for \(n+1\):%
\begin{align*}
(n+1)^2 + n+1 \amp = n^2 + 2n + 1 + n + 1\\
\amp = n^2 + n + 2n + 2.
\end{align*}
But \(n^2 + n\) is even, and \(2n + 2\) is even, and the sum of two even numbers is even, so \((n+1)^2 + n+1\) is even.%
\end{proof}
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-251}{}%
Now that we have some sense for mathematical induction in general, let's consider how induction can be applied in graph theory.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-252}{}%
First, we need something to play the role of \(n\), since induction is used to prove statements are true for all natural numbers \(n\).  For the most part, we cannot think of all graphs as lined up in some natural order.  But we could use induction \emph{on} the number of edges of a graph (or number of vertices, or any other notion of size).  That is we can prove that for all \(n\ge 0\), all graphs with \(n\) edges have \textellipsis{}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-253}{}%
Notice that the thing we are proving for all \(n\) is itself a universally quantified statement. This means that our base case become, ``for all graphs with 0 edges \textellipsis{}'' (which for not-necessarily connected graphs is infinitely many graphs).  To prove the inductive case we \emph{get to} assume that for all graphs with \(n\) edges \textellipsis{}, but then we \emph{must} prove that for all graphs with \(n+1\) edges \textellipsis{}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-254}{}%
Because of this added complication, the usual way to approach the inductive case for graphs is to start with an arbitrary graph that has \(n+1\) edges.  Then remove an edge to drop down to a graph with \(n\) edges, which we know something about (our inductive hypothesis).  Then make sure that moving back to the original graph, we maintain our desired property.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-255}{}%
Let's try a simple example.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-18}
\hypertarget{p-256}{}%
Recall that a \terminology{tree} is a connected graph with no cycles.  We wish to prove that every tree with \(v = n\) vertices has \(e = n-1\) edges.  (This is actually a special case of Euler's formula for planar graphs, as a tree will always be a planar graph with 1 face).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]

~\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{a-23.b}{[hint]}\hypertarget{q-23.b}{}}\item\label{task-30} \hypertarget{p-261}{}%
Now for the inductive case.  Start with an arbitrary tree \(T\) with \(n\) vertices and assume that \emph{all} trees with \(n-1\) vertices have \(n-2\) edges (why is the the right thing to assume)?  Prove that \(T\) has \(n-1\) edges.%

\hypertarget{p-264}{}%
The proof we will give will be by induction on the number of edges of a graph.  This means we will need a way to reduce the number of edges, so we can get down to our inductive hypothesis.  There are two ways to remove an edge that will be useful here and for future problems.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-265}{}%
\index{deletion} A \terminology{deletion} is the result of removing an edge from the edge set (everything else in the graph stays the same).  For a specific edge \(e\) in the graph \(G\), we write the new graph as \(G - e\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-266}{}%
\index{contraction} Slightly more complicated is a \terminology{contraction}.  The idea is we take an edge and shrink it down to a vertex.  The two endpoints of the vertex collide and all their incident edges follow along and become incident to this new vertex consisting of the edge and two vertices contracted together.  The resulting graph is written \(G/e\) (read ``\(G\) contract \(e\)'').%
\par
\hypertarget{p-267}{}%
To be a little more precise, given a graph \(G\) and edge \(e = \{u,v\}\), the graph \(G/e\) is formed by \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-27}{}\hypertarget{p-268}{}%
Removing vertices \(u\) and \(v\) and all their incident vertices.%
\item\hypertarget{li-28}{}\hypertarget{p-269}{}%
Adding a new vertex \(E\) and edges from \(E\) to each vertex that was previously adjacent to \(u\) or \(v\).%
\end{enumerate}
 Notice that \(G/e\) might be a multigraph (if \(u\) and \(v\) were both adjacent to a common vertex).  If \(G\) was already a multigraph, and had two edges connecting \(u\) and \(v\), then \(E\) will get a loop (since only one of the edges was contracted).  We can avoid multigraphs by being careful which edge we contract along.%

Before proceeding, consider carefully the style of proof used here.  This is a \terminology{proof by contradiction}.  We assumed the opposite of what we wanted to show.

\hypertarget{p-291}{}%
In a proof by contradiction, we assume \(P\) (which will be the negation of our desired conclusion) and derive \(Q\), a contradiction.  That valid derivation allows us to conclude \(P \imp Q\) is \emph{true}!  But we know that \(Q\) is false.  What does that say about \(P\)?  If the implication is true and the consequent (``then'' part) is false, it must be that we are in row 4 of the truth table.  In that row, \(P\) is false.  So we are justified in concluding \(\neg P\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-292}{}%
In our case, \(P\) was the statement ``\(K_5\) is planar.''  So when we get a contradiction (a false \(Q\)), we can conclude that \(K_5\) is not planar.  Note that even though we are proving something about a graph that does not satisfy Euler's formula for planar graphs, by using a proof by contradiction, we get to \emph{use} the formula.%

A cube\index{cube} is an example of a convex polyhedron. It contains 6 identical squares for its faces, 8 vertices, and 12 edges. The cube is a \terminology{regular polyhedron} (also known as a \terminology{Platonic solid}\index{Platonic solids}) because each face is an identical regular polygon and each vertex joins an equal number of faces.%
\par

There are exactly four other regular polyhedra: the tetrahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron with 4, 8, 12 and 20 faces respectively. How many vertices and edges do each of these have?%
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-319}{}%
Another area of mathematics that uses the terms ``vertex,'' ``edge,'' and ``face'' is geometry. A \terminology{polyhedron}\index{polyhedron} is a geometric solid made up of flat polygonal faces joined at edges and vertices. We are especially interested in \terminology{convex}\index{convex} polyhedra, which means that any line segment connecting two points on the interior of the polyhedron must be entirely contained inside the polyhedron.\footnote{An alternative definition for convex is that the internal angle formed by any two faces must be less than \(180\deg\).\label{fn-3}}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-320}{}%
Notice that since \(8 - 12 + 6 = 2\), the vertices, edges and faces of a cube satisfy Euler's formula for planar graphs. This is not a coincidence. We can represent a cube as a planar graph by projecting the vertices and edges onto the plane. One such projection looks like this:%

In fact, \emph{every} convex polyhedron can be projected onto the plane without edges crossing. Think of placing the polyhedron inside a sphere, with a light at the center of the sphere. The edges and vertices of the polyhedron cast a shadow onto the interior of the sphere. You can then cut a hole in the sphere in the middle of one of the projected faces and ``stretch'' the sphere to lay down flat on the plane. The face that was punctured becomes the ``outside'' face of the planar graph.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-322}{}%
The point is, we can apply what we know about graphs (in particular planar graphs) to convex polyhedra. Since every convex polyhedron can be represented as a planar graph, we see that Euler's formula for planar graphs holds for all convex polyhedra as well. We also can apply the same sort of reasoning we use for graphs in other contexts to convex polyhedra. For example, we know that there is no convex polyhedron with 11 vertices all of degree 3, as this would make 33/2 edges.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-8}

Is there a convex polyhedron consisting of three triangles and six pentagons? What about three triangles, six pentagons and five heptagons (7-sided polygons)?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-27}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-324}{}%
How many edges would such polyhedra have? For the first proposed polyhedron, the triangles would contribute a total of 9 edges, and the pentagons would contribute 30. However, this counts each edge twice (as each edge borders exactly two faces), giving 39/2 edges, an impossibility. There is no such polyhedron.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-325}{}%
The second polyhedron does not have this obstacle. The extra 35 edges contributed by the heptagons give a total of 74/2 = 37 edges. So far so good. Now how many vertices does this supposed polyhedron have? We can use Euler's formula. There are 14 faces, so we have \(v - 37 + 14 = 2\) or equivalently \(v = 25\). But now use the vertices to count the edges again. Each vertex must have degree \emph{at least} three (that is, each vertex joins at least three faces since the interior angle of all the polygons must be less that \(180^\circ\)), so the sum of the degrees of vertices is at least 75. Since the sum of the degrees must be exactly twice the number of edges, this says that there are strictly more than 37 edges. Again, there is no such polyhedron.%

Mapmakers in the fictional land of Euleria have drawn the borders of the various dukedoms of the land. To make the map pretty, they wish to color each region. Adjacent regions must be colored differently, but it is perfectly fine to color two distant regions with the same color. What is the fewest colors the mapmakers can use and still accomplish this task?%

How many colors do you need to color the faces of a cube so that no two faces that share an edge are colored the same?  Is there a polyhedron that would require four colors to do this?  Is there a polyhedron that requires five?%

Perhaps the most famous graph theory problem is how to color maps.%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-2}{}
\hypertarget{p-354}{}%
Given any map of countries, states, counties, etc., how many colors are needed to color each region on the map so that neighboring regions are colored differently?%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-355}{}%
Actual map makers usually use around seven colors. For one thing, they require watery regions to be a specific color, and with a lot of colors it is easier to find a permissible coloring. We want to know whether there is a smaller palette that will work for any map.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-356}{}%
How is this related to graph theory? Well, if we place a vertex in the center of each region (say in the capital of each state) and then connect two vertices if their states share a border, we get a graph. Coloring regions on the map corresponds to coloring the vertices of the graph. Since neighboring regions cannot be colored the same, our graph cannot have vertices colored the same when those vertices are adjacent.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-357}{}%
In general, given any graph \(G\), a coloring of the vertices with \(k\) colors is called a \terminology{\(k\)-coloring}\index{vertex coloring}\index{\(k\)-coloring}. If the coloring has the property that adjacent vertices are colored differently, then the coloring is called \terminology{proper}. Every graph has a proper \(k\)-coloring for some \(k\). For example, you could color every vertex with a different color. But often you can do better. The smallest \(k\) for which there is a proper \(k\)-coloring is called the \terminology{chromatic number}\index{chromatic number} of the graph, written \(\chi(G)\)\label{notation-6}

\hypertarget{p-359}{}%
The graph on the left is \(K_6\). The only way to properly color the graph is to give every vertex a different color (since every vertex is adjacent to every other vertex). Thus the chromatic number is 6.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-360}{}%
The middle graph can be properly colored with just 3 colors (Red, Blue, and Green). For example:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0.375}{0.375}{0}
\begin{sbspanel}{0.25}
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{{

	    \end{tikzpicture}
}
}
\end{sbspanel}
\end{sidebyside}
\par
\hypertarget{p-361}{}%
There is no way to color it with just two colors, since there are three vertices mutually adjacent (i.e., a triangle). Thus the chromatic number is 3.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-362}{}%
The graph on the right is just \(K_{2,3}\). As with all bipartite graphs, this graph has chromatic number 2: color the vertices on the top row red and the vertices on the bottom row blue.%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-363}{}%
It appears that there is no limit to how large chromatic numbers can get; the graph \(K_n\) has chromatic number \(n\). So how could there possibly be an answer to the original map coloring question? If the chromatic number of graph can be arbitrarily large, then it seems like there would be no upper bound to the number of colors needed for any map. But there is.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-364}{}%
The key observation is that while it is true that for any number \(n\), there is a graph with chromatic number \(n\), only some graphs arrive as representations of maps. If you convert a map to a graph, the edges between vertices correspond to borders between the countries. So you should be able to connect vertices in such a way where the edges do not cross. In other words, the graphs representing maps are all \emph{planar}!%
\par
\hypertarget{p-365}{}%
So the question is, what is the largest chromatic number of any planar graph? The answer is the infamous Four Color Theorem.%
\begin{theorem}[{The Four Color Theorem}]\label{theorem-5}
\hypertarget{p-366}{}%
\index{Four Color Theorem} If \(G\) is a planar graph, then the chromatic number of \(G\) is less than or equal to 4. Thus any map can be properly colored with 4 or fewer colors.%
\end{theorem}
\hypertarget{p-367}{}%
We will not prove this theorem. Really. Even though the theorem is easy to state and understand, the proof is not. In fact, there is currently no ``easy'' known proof of the theorem. The current best proof still requires powerful computers to check an \emph{unavoidable set} of 633 \emph{reducible configurations}. The idea is that every graph must contain one of these reducible configurations (this fact also needs to be checked by a computer) and that reducible configurations can, in fact, be colored in 4 or fewer colors.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-368}{}%
Of course if every planar graph has chromatic number at most 4, then every graph has chromatic number no more than 6.  Proving this (even without using the 4 color theorem) is not very difficult, and this at least shows that the chromatic numbers for planar graphs is bounded.%

In 1879, Alfred Kempe published a proof of the Four Color Theorem.  It wasn't until 11 years later that Percy John Heawood found an error in the proof.  However, the failed proof did lead to a nice proof that every planar graph has chromatic number at most five.  The next activity walks you through that proof.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-32}
\hypertarget{p-374}{}%
We will prove the Five Color Theorem, that every planar graph has a proper vertex coloring using five (or fewer) colors.  We proceed by induction on the number of vertices.  So assume that \(G\) is a planar graph with \(n\) vertices, and all planar graphs with fewer vertices have a proper 5-coloring.  We will use \(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\) as our set of colors.%

Now consider the induced subgraph \(H_{1,3}\) of \(H\) consisting of all vertices colored 1 and 3 (and their edges).  Why can we assume that there is a path from \(v_1\) to \(v_3\) contained in \(H_{1,3}\)?%

You will notice that the proof above doesn't ever use \(v_5\), so it is tempting to apply this same technique to prove the four color theorem.  See if you can find the error in doing so in fewer than 11 years.%

Graphs that do not contain \(K_3\) are called \terminology{triangle-free}.

Six friends decide to spend the afternoon playing chess. Everyone will play everyone else once. They have plenty of chess sets but nobody wants to play more than one game at a time. Games will last an hour (thanks to their handy chess clocks). How many hours will the tournament last?%

In general, what can we say about chromatic index? Certainly \(\chi'(G) \ge \Delta(G)\). But how much higher could it be? Only a little higher.%
\begin{theorem}[{Vizing's Theorem}]\label{theorem-7}
\hypertarget{p-434}{}%
\index{Vizing's Theorem} For any graph \(G\), the chromatic index \(\chi'(G)\) is either \(\Delta(G)\) or \(\Delta(G) + 1\).%
\end{theorem}
\hypertarget{p-435}{}%
At first this theorem makes it seem like chromatic index might not be very interesting. However, deciding which case a graph is in is not always easy. Graphs for which \(\chi'(G) = \Delta(G)\) are called \emph{class 1}, while the others are called \emph{class 2}. Bipartite graphs always satisfy \(\chi'(G) = \Delta(G)\), so are class 1 (this was proved by König in 1916, decades before Vizing proved his theorem in 1964). In 1965 Vizing proved that all planar graphs with \(\Delta(G) \ge 8\) are of class 1, but this does not hold for all planar graphs with \(2 \le \Delta(G) \le 5\). Vizing conjectured that all planar graphs with \(\Delta(G) = 6\) or \(\Delta(G) = 7\) are class 1; the \(\Delta(G) = 7\) case was proved in 2001 by Sanders and Zhao; the \(\Delta(G) = 6\) case is still open.%

There is another interesting way we might consider coloring edges, quite different from what we have discussed so far. What if we colored every edge of a graph either red or blue. Can we do so without, say, creating a \emph{monochromatic}\index{monochromatic} triangle (i.e., an all red or all blue triangle)? Certainly for some graphs the answer is yes.%

More generally, we can ask for the smallest number \(R = R(m,n)\) such that no matter how we color the edges of \(K_R\) using red and blue, there will either be a red copy of \(K_m\) or a blue copy of \(K_n\).  The number \(R(m,n)\) is called a \terminology{Ramsey number}.  The previous activity proves that \(R(3,3) = 6\).%

We can also color the edges with more colors.  For example, \(R(3,3,3) = 17\), which says that if you color the edges of \(K_{17}\) red, blue and green, there is guaranteed to be a monochromatic triangle in one of these colors.%

\hypertarget{p-458}{}%
In any \terminology{matching} is a subset \(M\) of the edges for which no two edges of \(M\) are incident to a common vertex.  If every vertex belongs to exactly one of the edges, we say the matching is \terminology{perfect}. Our goal is to discover some criterion for when a bipartite graph has a prefect matching.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-459}{}%
\index{matching} Suppose you have a bipartite graph \(G\). This will consist of two sets of vertices \(A\) and \(B\) with some edges connecting some vertices of \(A\) to some vertices in \(B\) (but of course, no edges between two vertices both in \(A\) or both in \(B\)). A \terminology{matching} of \(G\) is a set of \terminology{independent edges}, meaning no two edges in the set are adjacent.  If every vertex in \(G\) is incident to exactly one edge in the matching, we call the matching \terminology{perfect}. If a bipartite graph has a perfect matching, then \(\card{A} = \card{B}\), but in general, we could have a \terminology{matching of \(A\)}, which will mean that every vertex in \(A\) is incident to an edge in the matching.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-460}{}%
Some context might make this easier to understand. Think of the vertices in \(A\) as representing students in a class, and the vertices in \(B\) as representing presentation topics. We put an edge from a vertex \(a \in A\) to a vertex \(b \in B\) if student \(a\) would like to present on topic \(b\). Of course, some students would want to present on more than one topic, so their vertex would have degree greater than 1. As the teacher, you want to assign each student their own unique topic. Thus you want to find a matching of \(A\): you pick some subset of the edges so that each student gets matched up with exactly one topic, and no topic gets matched to two students.\footnote{The standard example for matchings used to be the \emph{marriage problem} in which \(A\) consisted of the men in the town, \(B\) the women, and an edge represented a marriage that was agreeable to both parties.  A matching then represented a way for the town elders to marry off everyone in the town, no polygamy allowed.\label{fn-6}}%

One way \(G\) could not have a matching is if there is a vertex in \(A\) not adjacent to any vertex in \(B\) (so having degree 0). What else? What if two students both like the same one topic, and no others? Then after assigning that one topic to the first student, there is nothing left for the second student to like, so it is very much as if the second student has degree 0. Or what if three students like only two topics between them. Again, after assigning one student a topic, we reduce this down to the previous case of two students liking only one topic. We can continue this way with more and more students. %
\par
\hypertarget{p-467}{}%
It should be clear at this point that if there is every a group of \(n\) students who as a group like \(n-1\) or fewer topics, then no matching is possible. This is true for any value of \(n\), and any group of \(n\) students.%

To make this more graph-theoretic, say you have a set \(S \subseteq A\) of vertices. Define \(N(S)\)\label{notation-8}
 to be the set of all the \terminology{neighbors}\index{neighbors} of vertices in \(S\). That is, \(N(S)\) contains all the vertices (in \(B\)) which are adjacent to at least one of the vertices in \(S\). (In the student/topic graph, \(N(S)\) is the set of topics liked by the students of \(S\).) Our discussion above can be summarized as follows:%
\begin{lemma}[{Matching Condition}]\label{lemma-1}
\hypertarget{p-469}{}%
\index{matching condition} If a bipartite graph \(G = \{A, B\}\) has a matching of \(A\), then%

Does that mean that there is a matching? Surprisingly, yes. The obvious necessary condition is also sufficient.\footnote{This happens often in graph theory.  If you can avoid the obvious counterexamples, you often get what you want.\label{fn-7}} This is a theorem first proved by Philip Hall in 1935.\footnote{There is also an infinite version of the theorem which was proved by the unrelated Marshal Hall, Jr.\label{fn-8}}%

One way you might check to see whether a partial matching is maximal is to construct an \terminology{alternating path}. This is a path whose adjacent edges alternate between edges in the matching and edges not in the matching (no edge can be used more than once, since this is a path). If an alternating path starts and stops with vertices that are \emph{not} matched, (that is, these vertices are not incident to any edge in the matching) then the path is called an \terminology{augmenting path}.%

\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-508}{}%
We would like to understand why the patterns you discovered above exist, and to prove that they really do exist everywhere in the triangle.  There are at least two ways we can proceed (and we will try to proceed in both ways to maximize our understanding).  First, we can use notation to describe the entries in the triangle, provide a definition for what each entry is, and prove our results entirely based on these definitions.  Second, we can ascribe some \emph{meaning} to the entries in the triangle, saying what the numbers represent, and then make arguments about those representations.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-509}{}%
 The advantage to pursuing both these approaches is that doing so creates a feedback loop.  A fact we establish using pure symbolic manipulation allows us to conclude something about the real world and what these numbers represent.  That helps us understand the applications better, which in turn might help us make arguments about those applications, which can then establish a purely symbolic fact about the triangle.%

Some definitions: A \terminology{bit} is either 0 or 1 (bit is short for ``binary digit'').  Thus a \terminology{bit string} is a string of bits.  The \terminology{length} of a bit string is the number of bits in the string; the \terminology{weight} of a bit string is the number of 1's in the string (or equivalently, the sum of the bits). A \terminology{\(n\)-bit string} means a bit string of length \(n\).%

\hypertarget{p-546}{}%
If you want to prove that two sets have the same number of elements, all that is requires is to define a function from one set to the other, and prove that the function is a bijection.  For us, those two sets will be the set of outcomes we are counting.  So for example, we can show that the \emph{set} of \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\) has the same cardinality as the \emph{set} of \(k\)-element subsets of \([n]\).  This will prove that the counting questions, ``how many \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\) are there?'' and, ``how many \(k\)-element subsets of \([n]\) are there?'' have the same answer.%

\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-551}{}%
So all these counting questions correspond to each other.  Why do the answers always fall in Pascal's triangle?  To answer this, we need to start with a definition for the numbers in Pascal's triangle.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-552}{}%
First, some notation: let's write \(\binom{n}{k}\) for the \(k\)th entry in row \(n\).  For both \(n\) and \(k\), start counting at 0.  So for example \(\binom{5}{1} = 5\), and \(\binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n} = 1\) for all \(n\) (or at least the ones we can see).  We will read \(\binom{n}{k}\) as ``\(n\) choose \(k\)'' for reasons that will become clear soon.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-553}{}%
Now we need to decide what \(\binom{n}{k}\) should be defined as.  It is not enough to simply define it as the specific entry in Pascal's triangle, since we haven't yet defined Pascal's triangle (we will want to define Pascal's triangle as the triangle of the numbers \(\binom{n}{k}\)).  Here are some choices:%
\begin{assemblage}[Possible Definitions for \(\binom{n}{k}\)]\label{assemblage-1}
\hypertarget{p-554}{}%
\index{binomial coefficients} For each integer \(n \ge 0\) and integer \(k\) with \(0 \le k \le n\) the number%
\begin{equation*}
{n\choose k},
\end{equation*}
read ``\(n\) choose \(k\)'' is: \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-34}{}the number of \(n\)-bit strings of weight \(k\), that is, \({n\choose k} = |\B^n_k|\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-35}{}\({n \choose k}\) is the number of subsets of a set of size \(n\) each with cardinality \(k\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-36}{}\({n \choose k}\) is the number of lattice paths of length \(n\) containing \(k\) steps to the right.%
\item\hypertarget{li-37}{}\({n \choose k}\) is the coefficient of \(x^ky^{n-k}\) in the expansion of \((x+y)^n\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-38}{}\({n \choose k}\) is the number of ways to select \(k\) objects from a total of \(n\) objects.%
\item\hypertarget{li-39}{}\hypertarget{p-555}{}%
\(\binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n} = 1\) and for all \(n \ge 1\) and \(1 \lt k \lt n\) we have \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}\).%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-556}{}%
You have already prove that choices 1, 2 and 3 are equivalent, and we have good reason to believe these are also equivalent to choice 4.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-557}{}%
What about choice 5?  This is new, although not really, as it captures all of the previous four: Each of our counting problems above can be viewed in this way: \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-558}{}%
How many bit strings have length 5 and weight 3?  We must choose \(3\) of the 5 bits to be 1's.  There are \({5 \choose 3}\) ways to do this, so there are \({5 \choose 3}\) such bit strings.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-559}{}%
How many subsets of \(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\) contain exactly 3 elements?  We must choose \(3\) of the 5 elements to be in our subset.  There are \({5 \choose 3}\) ways to do this, so there are \({5 \choose 3}\) such subsets.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-560}{}%
How many lattice paths are there from (0,0) to (3,2)?  We must choose 3 of the 5 steps to be towards the right.  There are \({5 \choose 3}\) ways to do this, so there are \({5 \choose 3}\) such lattice paths.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-561}{}%
What is the coefficient of \(x^3y^2\) in the expansion of \((x+y)^5\)?  We must choose 3 of the 5 copies of the binomial to contribute an \(x\).  There are \({5 \choose 3}\) ways to do this, so the coefficient is \({5 \choose 3}\).%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-562}{}%
In fact, choice 5 is usually taken as the definition of \(\binom{n}{k}\), which is why we say \(n\) \emph{choose} \(k\).  Although interestingly enough, the other common name for \(\binom{n}{k}\) is a \terminology{binomial coefficient}, which refers to the coefficients of the binomial \((x+y)^n\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-563}{}%
What does all this have to do with Pascal's triangle though?  If you are like me, you think of the entries in the triangle as the result of adding the two entries above it.  That is, Pascal's triangle contains those numbers described by choice 6 above.%
\begin{assemblage}[Recurrence relation for \({n \choose k}\)]\label{assemblage-2}
\hypertarget{p-564}{}%
For any \(n \ge 1\) and \(0 \lt k \lt n\):%

{n \choose k} = {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-565}{}%
The last piece of the puzzle is to connect this definition to all the others.  Of course given the work done above, it would be enough to prove that any one of the models for binomial coefficients match the recurrence for Pascal's triangle, but it is instructive to check all four.%

\hypertarget{p-570}{}%
At last we can rest easy that can use Pascal's triangle to calculate binomial coefficients and as such find numeric values for the answers to counting questions. How many pizza's containing three distinct toppings can you make if the pizza place offers 10 toppings?  Well the answer should be \(\binom{10}{3}\), and Pascal's triangle says that is 120.%

\hypertarget{p-574}{}%
For all \(n \ge 0\) and all \(0 \le k \le n\) we have \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n}{n-k}\).  In other words, Pascal's triangle is symmetric reflected over its vertical altitude.%

\end{theorem}
\hypertarget{p-576}{}%
These are just two of the beautiful identities hidden in Pascal's triangle.  But why are they true?%

\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-65}
\hypertarget{p-580}{}%
First, an algebraic proof.  We will see later that \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\), where \(r! = r \cdot (r-1) \cdot (r-2) \cdot\cdots\cdot 2\cdot 1\) (read ``\(r\) factorial'').  Using this algebraic formula, prove the identity.%
~\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{a-72}{[hint]}\hypertarget{q-72}{}}\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-583}{}%
Note that this proof was not by any means difficult, but it did rely on an algebraic identity we have yet to prove.  We will see in \hyperref[act-pascalrowsum-alg]{Activity~\ref{act-pascalrowsum-alg}} that algebraic proofs can be very messy.  What's more, nothing about these proofs explain \emph{why} the identity is true.  They lack meaning.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-66}

Why is the above enough to establish the identity?%

How are \hyperref[act-pascalsym-dc]{Activity~\ref{act-pascalsym-dc}} and \hyperref[act-pascalsym-bij]{Activity~\ref{act-pascalsym-bij}} different?  The first consists of answering a single counting question in two different ways, and those ways are the two sides of the identity.  Such proofs are sometimes called \emph{double counting proofs}, or sometimes just \emph{combinatorial proofs}.  On the other hand, \hyperref[act-pascalsym-bij]{Activity~\ref{act-pascalsym-bij}} proceeds by showing two different sets have the same size, using a bijection, and shows that these two sets are counted by each side of the identity.  These proofs are called \emph{bijective proofs} (and are also sometimes grouped together with double counting proofs as combinatorial proofs).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-605}{}%
Both styles of combinatorial proof have the advantage that they do an excellent job of illustrating what is really going on in an identity.  They reinforce our understanding of how to solve counting problems and our understanding of basic combinatorial principles.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-606}{}%
This is not to say that other proof techniques, especially mathematical induction, are not also helpful.  Inductive proofs demonstrate the importance of the recursive nature of combinatorics.  Even if we didn't know what Pascal's triangle told us about the real world, we would see that the identity was true entirely based on the recursive definition of its entries.%

Now here are four proofs of \hyperref[thm-pascalrowsum]{Theorem~\ref{thm-pascalrowsum}}.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{act-pascalrowsum-alg}
\hypertarget{p-608}{}%
Using the formula \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k!)}\), you should be able to find a common denominator in the sum \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}\) and show that this simplifies to \(2^n\).%

\hypertarget{p-615}{}%
There are lots of ways to give a combinatorial proof.  Here is one.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-pascalrow-dc}
\hypertarget{p-616}{}%
Consider the question: how many subsets of \([n]\) are there?%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-112} \hypertarget{p-617}{}%
How many subsets have cardinality 0?  How many have cardinality 1?  And so on.  How many would all of these give us all together?%

\hypertarget{p-623}{}%
Conclude: Since each side of the identity is the answer to the same counting question, we have established the identity.%
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-624}{}%
We will not give a bijective proof, although you might include this as part of the above if you didn't see why \(2^n\) was the number of subsets of \([n]\).  Instead, you might see directly that \(2^n\) is the number of \(n\)-bit strings (by writing the numbers 0 through \(2^n - 1\) in binary) and then define a bijection from \(n\)-bit strings to subsets of \([n]\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-625}{}%
Finally, here is a clever proof of the identity.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{act-pascalrowsum-binom}
\hypertarget{p-626}{}%
What does the binomial theorem say again?  That is, expand \((x+y)^n\).  What happens when you substitute \(x = y = 1\)?%

\hypertarget{p-629}{}%
This use of the binomial theorem is an example of one of the many uses for \emph{generating functions} which we will return to later.  For now, you might enjoy plugging in other values to the binomial theorem to uncover new binomial identities.%

\hypertarget{p-630}{}%
Any proof you write in mathematics must assume some foundational principles.  In Euclidean geometry, you have axioms, common notions, and often other propositions, used as justification in your proof.  Let's pause to consider two foundational principles in combinatorics that, while intuitively obvious, are worth pointing out as foundational.%

\item\hypertarget{li-48}{}\hypertarget{p-636}{}%

\end{enumerate}
%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-637}{}%
When solving a counting question, it is often advantageous to break the problem into parts.  If you think of the counting question as asking how many ways there are to complete a task, then you might break that task up in various ways, count the number of ways to complete each sub-task, and them combine those somehow to get the number of ways to complete the overall task.  How do you combine them?%
\begin{assemblage}[Sum Principle]\label{assemblage-3}
\hypertarget{p-638}{}%
The \terminology{sum principle}\index{sum principle} states that if task \(A\) can be completed in \(m\) ways, and task \(B\) can be completed in \(n\) \emph{disjoint} ways, then completing ``\(A\) or \(B\)'' is a task that can be completed in \(m + n\) ways.%
\end{assemblage}
\begin{assemblage}[Product Principle]\label{assemblage-4}
\hypertarget{p-639}{}%
The \terminology{product principle}\index{product principle} states that if task \(A\) can be completed in \(m\) ways, and each possibility for \(A\) allows for exactly \(n\) ways for task \(B\) to be completed, then the task ``\(A\) and \(B\)'' (or ``\(A\) followed by \(B\)'') can be completed in \(m \cdot n\) ways.%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-640}{}%
Note, while both the sum and product principle are true for more than two subtasks, which you could prove easily by induction from the versions given above.  But how do we know these principles are true?%
\par
\hypertarget{p-641}{}%
To make these principles more mathematically rigorous, consider operations on sets.%
\begin{proposition}[{}]\label{prop-unioncard}
\hypertarget{p-642}{}%
If \(A\) and \(B\) are finite, disjoint sets (so \(A \cap B = \emptyset\)) then \(\card{A \cup B} = \card{A} + \card{B}\).%
\end{proposition}
\hypertarget{p-643}{}%
This suggests that the union of (disjoint) sets somehow corresponds to the \emph{disjunction} (or) of completing tasks.  You might guess that the set operation that corresponds to \emph{conjunction} (and) of tasks is set intersection.  But this cannot be correct: the intersection of two sets is no larger than the smallest of the two sets, while combining tasks with conjunction apparently corresponds to multiplication.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-644}{}%
A better way to think of the conjunction is as \emph{concatenation}.  You are performing one task, \emph{followed} by the other.  Recall that \(A \times B = \{(a,b) \st a \in A, b \in B\}\) is the \terminology{Cartesian product} of \(A\) and \(B\); the set of all ordered pairs where the first element comes from \(A\) and the second from \(B\).  This is exactly what we need.%
\begin{proposition}[{}]\label{prop-prodcard}
\hypertarget{p-645}{}%
If \(A\) and \(B\) are finite sets, then \(\card{A \times B} = \card{A} \cdot \card{B}\)%
\end{proposition}
\hypertarget{p-646}{}%
We could prove these two propositions without too much trouble.  Then we must explain what they have to do with the sum and product principle.%

\item\label{task-122} \hypertarget{p-652}{}%
Using the same incomplete deck of cards (containing the Jack, King and Queen of diamonds, King of hearts, and 2 through 6 of spades), the magician asks you to put any face card face down under any face down black card.  How many choices do you have for this two card stack?%
\item\label{task-123} \hypertarget{p-653}{}%

\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-655}{}%
The previous activity might obscure an important subtlety.  Perhaps you said that the set \(A\) corresponds to the face cards (or to the set of outcomes of the task of selecting a face card) and the set \(B\) corresponded to the black cards.  The set of outcomes of picking a two card stack is exactly then \(A \times B\), so there are \(4\cdot 5 = 20\) outcomes.  This is completely correct.  But does it generalize?%
\begin{activity}[]\label{act-cardstacks}

The Product Principle is not exactly analogous to finding the cardinality of a Cartesian product after all, since tasks \(A\) and \(B\) do not need to be disjoint.  How do we make sense of the Product Principle then?%

\hypertarget{p-663}{}%
To illustrate just how fundamental these two principles are, here are a few counting problems that can be solved with them.  For each of these, say exactly where and how the sum and product principles are used.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{act-latticepaths2}
\hypertarget{p-664}{}%
We have seen that the number of lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((x,y)\) is given by \(\binom{x+y}{x}\).  Now with the sum and product principles, we can answer lots of questions about lattice paths.%

How many lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((10,10)\) pass through \((4,7)\) or \((7,4)\)?%
\item\label{task-133} \hypertarget{p-670}{}%
Explain why can you NOT use the sum principle to answer this question: How many lattice paths from \((0,0)\) to \((10,10)\) pass through \((4,7)\) or \((7,8)\)?  What is the answer?%
~\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{a-85.d}{[hint]}\hypertarget{q-85.d}{}}\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-672}{}%
The last part of the previous activity illustrates what can go wrong if the sets \(A\) and \(B\) are not disjoint.  In general, we have,%
\begin{equation*}
\card{A \cup B} = \card{A} + \card{B} - \card{A \cap B}.
\end{equation*}
This is an example of the \emph{Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion}, which we will investigate further later.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-673}{}%
This next set of questions you can answer entirely using the product principle.  While all the activities ask questions with a general \(n\) and \(k\), it would be a good idea to first try to answer the corresponding question with specific numbers and then generalize.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{tennispairings1}
\hypertarget{p-674}{}%
A tennis club has \(2n\) members. We want to pair up the members by twos for singles matches.%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]

\hypertarget{p-687}{}%
Assuming \(k\le n\), in how many ways can we pass out \(k\) distinct pieces of fruit to \(n\) children if each child may get at most one? What is the number if \(k>n\)? Assume for both questions that we pass out all the fruit.%
~\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{a-90}{[hint]}\hypertarget{q-90}{}}\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-691}{}%
The last activity is an example of a \terminology{permutation}.  We are asking how to arrange \(k\) of the \(n\) kids (arranged by which fruit they get).  There are \(n!\) ways to arrange \(n\) elements, so there are \(n!\) permutations of \(n\) elements.  Often we only want to arrange some of these, so we would consider a \(k\)-permutation.   We will use this often enough that it deserves its own notation.%
\begin{assemblage}[\(k\)-permutations of \(n\) elements]\label{assemblage-permutation}
\hypertarget{p-692}{}%
\(P(n,k)\) is the number of \(k\)-permutations of \(n\) elements, the number of ways to \emph{arrange} \(k\) objects chosen from \(n\) distinct objects.%
\begin{equation*}
P(n,k) = n\cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \cdots \cdot (n-k+1) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-693}{}%
Some other examples of questions where the answer is a permutation: \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-694}{}%
How many 5-letter ``words'' (i.e., strings of symbols) contain no repeated letters?  There are 26 choices for the first letter, 25 for the second, 24 for the third, 23 for the fourth and 22 for the fifth, so there are \(26\cdot 25 \cdot 24 \cdot 23 \cdot 22 = P(26,5)\) such words.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-695}{}%
How many different shuffled decks of cards are possible?  There are 52 choices for the bottom card, 51 for the next, and so on.  So the answer is \(P(52,52) = 52!\)%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-696}{}%
How many \emph{injective} functions from \([k]\) to \([n]\) are there?  There are \(n\) choices for where 1 is sent, \(n-1\) choices for where \(2\) is sent (since the function is injective, 2 cannot be sent to the same element as 1), and so on.  So the answer is \(P(n,k)\).%
\end{itemize}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-697}{}%
While we are looking at permutations, let's also consider their counterpart, \emph{combinations}. The key distinction is that while a permutation counts different arrangements as different outcomes, a combination does not.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-84}
\hypertarget{p-698}{}%

\hypertarget{p-704}{}%
Hopefully you realized that the number of \(k\)-combinations of \(n\) elements is just \(\binom{n}{k}\).  This makes sense: you just need to choose which elements to take, you don't need to arrange them.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-705}{}%
Notice though that combinations and permutations \emph{are} related in some way.  What is that way?  Well, once you have chosen \(k\) elements from an \(n\)-element set, you could then \emph{arrange} those \(k\) elements to get a permutation.%

Some other ways to approach the previous activity might be one or more of the following: \(n2^{n - 1}\) looks like a derivative, so try differentiating \(\left( 1 + x \right)^{n}\); a reverse and add approach also works; or, first prove \(k \binom{n}{k} = n \binom{n - 1}{k - 1}\) and then use it.%

The above activity illustrates another important reason to use combinatorial proofs: to establish recurrence relations.  The next identity is also a recurrence, this time about \emph{derangements}.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-93}
\hypertarget{p-742}{}%
A \terminology{derangement} of a set of elements is a permutation of those elements so that no element appears in its original position.  For example, a derangement of \([4]\) might be \(3,1,4,2\), but the permutation \(3,2,4,1\) is not a derangement because \(2\) is still in the second position.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-743}{}%
Let \(d_{n}\) denote the number of derangements of \([n]\).  We will take \(d_{0} = 1\) and \(d_{1} = 0\).  Prove that \(d_{n} = (n - 1)(d_{n - 1}+ d_{n - 2})\) for \(n \geq 2\).%

\hypertarget{p-746}{}%
Later we will use the Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion to derive a formula for \(d_{n}\) from which the new recursion \(d_{n} = nd_{n - 1} + \left( - 1 \right)^{n}\), and the above recursion, can be derived.%

To close this section, let's return to a binomial identity we considered before, and consider a few additional proofs.%
\begin{theorem}[{}]\label{theorem-11}
\hypertarget{p-775}{}%
\(\binom{m + n}{2} - \binom{m}{2} - \binom{n}{2} = mn\) (revisited).%
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}\hypertarget{proof-6}{}
\hypertarget{p-776}{}%
We give three proofs: \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-52}{}\hypertarget{p-777}{}%
How many lines that are not vertical or horizontal can you form by connecting the points that are on the positive \(x\) and \(y\) axes? Since we really want only lines that are formed by connecting the \(m\) points with the \(n\) points, we could say we have \(mn\) lines. Or we could consider all \(m + n\) points and pick 2 in \(\binom{m+n}{2}\) ways and then delete those choices where you took 2 from \(m\) or 2 from \(n\), since these formed vertical and horizontal lines, respectively.  Thus \(\binom{m + n}{2} - \binom{m}{2} - \binom{n}{2} = mn\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-53}{}\hypertarget{p-778}{}%
There are \(mn\) one by one squares in the subdivided \(m\) by \(n\) rectangle.  Each choice of arrows (one horizontal, one vertical) specifies one of these squares.  Pick two arrows but don't take two from the top or two from the side.  Then \(\binom{m + n}{2} - \binom{m}{2} - \binom{n}{2} = mn\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-54}{}\hypertarget{p-779}{}%
Take \(m\) people in one group and \(n\) in another. How many handshakes can be accomplished? Among the \(m\) people there are \(\binom{m}{2}\) handshakes; among the \(n\) people there are \(\binom{n}{2}\) handshakes and between the two groups, \(mn\). But, \(\binom{m + n}{2}\) also represents the total number of handshakes among the people. Then we get: \(\binom{m}{2} + \binom{n}{2} + mn = \binom{m + n}{2}\).%
\end{enumerate}

So far we have been able to solve our counting problems simply by use of the sum and product principles, together with the fact that the number of \(k\)-element subsets of an \(n\)-element set is \(\binom{n}{k}\) (the values of which can be found in Pascal's triangle). This means that we have always \emph{built up} the set of outcomes by combining smaller sets of outcomes combined in various ways.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-781}{}%
It is often useful to go the other way.  We could purposely over count the number of outcomes, but in a way that we can recover the correct set.%

\hypertarget{p-782}{}%
In \hyperref[act-binomformula]{Activity~\ref{act-binomformula}}, you showed proved the algebraic formula \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}\).  However, this was done rather indirectly.  First you proved the binomial identity \(P(n,k) = \binom{n}{k}k!\) and then wrote \(P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\) and solved for \(\binom{n}{k}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-783}{}%
This approach has the advantage of illustrating the connection between combinations and permutations, but the combinatorial argument that both sides of the identity are equal asked you to count the number of \emph{permutations} in two ways.  It is instructive to think of this equation in terms of \emph{combinations} instead.  Let's start with a concrete example.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-101}
\hypertarget{p-784}{}%
Let's count the number of subsets of \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\) of size 3.  Of course we already know the answer should be \(\binom{5}{3}\), which we can see in Pascal's triangle is equal to 10.  What might you try if you didn't already know this?%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-142} \hypertarget{p-785}{}%
You might first guess that the answer is \(5\cdot 4 \cdot 3\) since there are 5 choices for which element you put in your subset first, then  4 choices for the next element, and 3 choices for the last element.  Write down all 60 of the outcomes you get by counting the ``subsets'' this way.\footnote{This might seem like a lot of busy work, but your efforts will be rewarded.\label{fn-9}}%
\item\label{task-143} \hypertarget{p-786}{}%
One of the subsets we are actually interested in is \(\{a,c,d\}\).  How many of the outcomes you listed above correspond to this set?  How many outcomes correspond to the set \(\{c,d,e\}\)?%
\item\label{task-144} \hypertarget{p-787}{}%
Explain why every subset corresponds to the same number of permutations.  Then use this to count the total number of subsets correctly.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-788}{}%
Let's look carefully at what we did above.  We had a set of permutations (all 60 of the 3-permutations of the set \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\)).  Then we noticed that some of these permutations corresponded the the same subset.  Saying that these permutations were related like this feels like defining a equivalence relation.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-102}
\hypertarget{p-789}{}%
Refer back to your list of 60 3-permutations of \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\).%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-145} \hypertarget{p-790}{}%
Define an \terminology{equivalence relation} on the permutations you listed so that permutations that ``correspond'' to the same subset are equivalent.  That is, give a rule that specifies when two permutations are ``equivalent''.%
~\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{a-109.a}{[hint]}\hypertarget{q-109.a}{}}\item\label{task-146} \hypertarget{p-792}{}%
In any set \(S\), if you have an equivalence relation \(\sim\), you can \terminology{partition} \(S\) into \terminology{equivalence classes}: sets of elements that are equivalent under \(\sim\) (i.e., sets of the form \(\{x \in S \st x \sim a\} \) for a particular element \(a\)).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-793}{}%
Write out the equivalence classes generated by the equivalence relation you gave above.  Explain why these all have the same size.  How many equivalence classes do you have (and how does this relate to the fact that they all have the same size)?%
\item\label{task-147} \hypertarget{p-794}{}%
Find a bijection between the set of equivalence classes and the set of subsets of \(\{a,b,c,d,e\}\).  Why is this important?%

\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-796}{}%
This suggests a general approach to solving a counting problem.  Say we want to count the number of elements in a set \(S\).  Suppose we can count the size of some set \(T\), perhaps containing many more elements than we are actually interested in counting.  Then define an equivalence relation \(\sim\) on \(T\) so that there is a bijection between \(S\) and the set of equivalence classes \(T/\sim\).  Then if we know the size of \(T/\sim\), we have the size of \(S\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-797}{}%
Look at the notation \(T/\sim\) that we used to denote the set of equivalence classes of \(T\) under \(\sim\).  This set is sometimes called the \terminology{quotient set} or \terminology{quotient space} of \(T\) by \(\sim\).  This is a good name, as you are dividing up a set into parts.  It is also a good name because sometimes we can conclude%
\begin{equation*}
|T/\sim| = |T|/|A|
\end{equation*}
where \(A\) is one of the equivalence classes under \(\sim\).  When can you do this?%
\par
\hypertarget{p-798}{}%
Note this is exactly what we did when we counted subsets: we divided the number of permutations by the number of permutations equivalent to each other.  That worked precisely because \emph{all the equivalence classes had the same size}!%
\par
\hypertarget{p-799}{}%
This justifies the \terminology{quotient principle} we now state.%
\begin{assemblage}[The Quotient Principle]\label{assemblage-quotientprinciple}
\hypertarget{p-800}{}%
If we partition a set of size \(p\) into \(q\) blocks, each of size \(r\), then \(q = p/r\).%

Notice that you can get a list from a seating arrangement by marking a place at the table, and then listing the people at the table, starting at that place and moving around to the right.) There are at least two different ways of doing this problem. Try to find them both, especially the one that uses the quotient principle.%

One way to distinguish combinations from permutations is by asking whether ``order matters''.  Both \(\binom{n}{k}\) and \(P(n,k)\) count the number of ways to select \(k\) objects from \(n\) objects without repeats, but you use the combination \(\binom{n}{k}\) when ``order doesn't matter'' and the permutation \(P(n,k)\) when ``order matters''.

\hypertarget{p-840}{}%
Understanding the role of order in distinguishing outcomes often suggests the use of the quotient principle.  You might say we arrive at combinations by counting permutations and modding out by the order.  Each block that corresponds to a single combination is a group of permutations that are only different because of their order.  Let's see if we can apply this to other counting questions.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-112}
\hypertarget{p-841}{}%
The ice cream shop is down to only 3 flavors.  If you wanted a 3-scoop cone or a 3-scoop shake, made without repeated flavors, there would only be 6 cones possible and only 1 shake.  But what if you allowed repeated flavors?%

Why doesn't the quotient principle apply here?  What goes wrong?  You might want to list out all 3-scoop cones and form the equivalence classes of shakes to see the issue.%
\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-847}{}%
The previous activity illustrates that you cannot always simply apply the quotient principle to eliminate order mattering.  What we are after in the 3-scoop shakes with possibly repeated flavors is a \terminology{multiset}, which is just like a set only we allow for elements to be in the set multiple times, but we still do not care in what order the elements are listed.  So an example of an \(4\)-element multiset of \([7]\) is \(\{1,3,3,6\}\), which is the same multiset as \(\{1,6,3,3\}\) but different from the multiset \(\{1,3,6\}\) (in particular, this multiset only has three elements).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-848}{}%
What we tried to do above was to count multisets by first counting sequences with possibly repeated elements, and then divide out by the number of sequences that just differ by the arrangement of a particular multiset.  But this didn't work, because the size of each block was not the same.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-849}{}%
However, we would still like to be able to count the number of multisets.  How can we do this?  Is it an application of the quotient principle after all?  To start, let's establish some notation.  The number of \(k\)-element subsets of \([n]\) was given by \(n\) choose \(k\) (written \(\binom{n}{k}\)), so we will say that the number of \(k\)-element \emph{multisets} of \([n]\) will be \terminology{\(n\) multichoose \(k\)}, and write \(\mchoose{n}{k}\).  From what we have seen above, we can say,%
\begin{equation*}
\mchoose{n}{k} \ne \frac{n^k}{k!}
\end{equation*}
despite the obvious allure of this possibility.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-850}{}%
Our question now is, what \emph{should} be in the numerator if not \(n^k\)?  First let's get more comfortable with thinking of multisets as a model for counting questions.%

The claim implicit in \hyperref[act-distributionintro]{Activity~\ref{act-distributionintro}} is that the number of ways to distribute \(n\) identical objects to \(k\) distinct recipients (now allowing each recipient to receive any number of objects, including zero) is \(\mchoose{n}{k}\).  If this is the case, then we should be able to think of the set of \(k\)-element multisets of \([n]\) as a distribution.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-115}
\hypertarget{p-861}{}%
Consider \(3\)-element multisets of \([5]\).  One of these is \(\{1,1,1\}\), and another is \(\{2,4,5\}\).  How are these two multisets like distributing three objects among 5 recipients?  What are the objects that you are distributing?%
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-862}{}%
Now let's consider a related distribution problem, where in some way, order now matters.  In fact, how is it that saying the distribution problems as in \hyperref[act-distributionintro]{Activity~\ref{act-distributionintro}} are ones for which order doesn't matter?  Look back at our standard example of order mattering or not:%

\item\label{task-163} \hypertarget{p-864}{}%

Consider the case where the books are distinct instead of identical.  Note also that in the next few activities, the usage of the variables \(k\) and \(n\) are reversed from above.  As you work through these next activities, think about why that choice was made.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{bookcase}
\hypertarget{p-866}{}%
Suppose we wish to place \(k\) distinct books onto the shelves of a bookcase with \(n\) shelves. For simplicity, assume for now that all of the books would fit on any of the shelves. Also, let's imagine pushing the books on a shelf as far to the left as we can, so that we are only thinking about how the books sit relative to each other, not about the exact places where we put the books. Since the books are distinct, we can think of the first book, the second book and so on.%

Once we have \(i-1\) books placed, if we want to place book \(i\)  on a shelf that already has some books, is sliding it in to the left of all the books already there different from placing it to the right of all the books already or between two books already there?%

\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-881}{}%
The assignment of which books go to which shelves of a bookcase is simply a function from the books to the shelves. But a function does not determine which book sits to the left of which others on the shelf, and this information is part of how the books are arranged on the shelves. In other words, the order in which the shelves receive their books matters.  Our function must thus assign an ordered list of books to each shelf. We will call such a function an ordered function. More precisely, an \terminology{ordered function}\index{ordered function}\index{function!ordered} from a set \(S\) to a set \(T\) is a function that assigns an (ordered) list of elements of \(S\) to some, but not necessarily all, elements of \(T\) in such a way that each element of \(S\) appears on one and only one of the lists.\footnote{The phrase ordered function is not a standard one, because there is as yet no standard name for the result of an ordered distribution problem.\label{fn-10}}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-882}{}%
We often think of functions as a rule that assigns an output to each input.  However, we could equally well specify a function by giving the complete inverse image of each element of the codomain.  That is, to define a (non-ordered) function \(f:S \to T\), we could give the set \(f\inv(t) = \{s \in S \st f(s) = t\}\) for each \(t \in T\).  The set of elements sent to \(t\) is a \emph{set} for a function, but for an ordered function, it is a \emph{sequence}.%

The number of ordered functions from a \(k\)-element set to an \(n\)-element set is%

\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-890}{}%
AHA!  The previous activity suggests that to count multisets, which is the same as counting distributions of identical objects to distinct recipients, we should apply the quotient principle to ordered functions.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-891}{}%
What should the equivalence relation be?  Think about bookshelves.  An ordered function is a distribution of distinct books to distinct shelves.  A multiset is a distribution of identical books to distinct shelves.  So we want two ordered functions to be equivalent if their corresponding shelves contain the same number of books (we no longer care what those books are, just how many there are).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-892}{}%
Now, given any ordered function, how many ordered functions are in its equivalence class?  We can get any other element in the class by permuting the books (but keeping the numbers in each shelf constant).  There are \(k\) books, so there are \(k!\) ways to permute them.  This is the same for \emph{every} ordered function, so the equivalence classes all have the same size.%

\hypertarget{p-893}{}%
Applying the quotient principle, we arrive at the following.%

\hypertarget{p-894}{}%
The number of \(k\)-element multisets of \([n]\) is%

\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-911}{}%
So far, we have only considered distribution problems in which the recipients are distinct.  There are plenty of situations where we would want to consider recipients identical.  For example, a problem we will take up in \hyperref[ch_advanced]{Chapter~\ref{ch_advanced}} is how many ways we can partition an integer.  For example, we could partition 5 as \(4+1\) or \(3+1+1\), but we would not want to also count \(1+4\) or \(1+3+1\) (doing so would be creating a \emph{composition}, which we have already considered).  We can think of the integer partition problem as distributing the 5 units that make up 5 into some number of identical bins.%

~\hfill{\tiny\hyperlink{a-131}{[hint]}\hypertarget{q-131}{}}\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-918}{}%
We can think of stacking books into identical boxes as partitioning the books and then ordering the blocks of the partition. This turns out not to be a useful computational way of visualizing the problem because the number of ways to order the books in the various stacks depends on the sizes of the stacks and not just the number of stacks. However this way of thinking actually led to the first hint in \hyperref[brokenpermutation]{Activity~\ref{brokenpermutation}}. Instead of dividing a set up into non-overlapping parts, we may think of dividing a \emph{permutation} (thought of as a list) of our \(k\) objects up into \(n\) ordered blocks. We will say that a set of ordered lists of elements of a set \(S\) is a \terminology{broken permutation} \index{broken permutation} \index{permutation!broken} of \(S\) if each element of \(S\) is in one and only one of these lists.\footnote{The phrase broken permutation is not standard, because there is no standard name for the solution to this kind  of distribution problem.\label{fn-11}} The number of broken permutations of a \(k\)-element set with \(n\) blocks is denoted by \(L(k,n)\). The number \(L(k,n)\) is called a \terminology{Lah Number} and, from our solution to \hyperref[brokenpermutation]{Activity~\ref{brokenpermutation}}, is equal to \(k!\binom{k-1}{n-1}/n!\).\index{Lah number}%

\hypertarget{p-920}{}%
What happens when you get stuck on a counting problem?  It is quite easy to miss the clever way of thinking about breaking down a task that leads to a solution.  Here is an example.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-921}{}%
Given any graph \(G = (V, E)\), an \terminology{independent set} (of vertices) is a subset \(I \subseteq V\) so that no two vertices in \(I\) are adjacent.  Suppose you wished to count the number of independent sets of a particular graph.  In this example, lets do so for the path \(P_{10}\) (i.e., the graph containing 11 vertices and 10 edges arranged in a line).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-922}{}%
Let's label the vertices 1 through 11, and assume that vertices are adjacent to those with labels one more or one less than themselves (that is, the edge set is \(E = \{(i,i+1) \st 1 \le i \lt 11\}\)).  How might you build an independent set?%
\par
\hypertarget{p-923}{}%
A first attempt might be to start with vertex 1 and realize that you can put it in or keep it out of the independent set.  So there are two choices for vertex 1.  But now you might have two choices for vertex 2 (if vertex 1 was not in the set) or only once choice (to keep vertex 2 out, if vertex 1 was in the set).  Okay, so the multiplicative principle doesn't help.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-924}{}%
Say you can't think of anything else to try.  The problem seems just too hard.  So make it easier.  10 is way too big of a number; 1 would be much better.  How many independent sets of \(P_1\) are there?  Maybe then we also try the version with 2 and 3.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-125}

\hypertarget{p-927}{}%
We get is a sequence \((a_n)_{n \ge 1}\) which gives the number of independent sets: the number of independent sets of \(P_n\) is simply \(a_n\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-928}{}%
The sequence we get is \(3, 5, 8, 13, \ldots\).  It \emph{appears} that this sequence satisfies a familiar recurrence relation, \(a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}\), but unlike the Fibonacci sequence, here the initial terms are \(a_1 = 3\) and \(a_2 = 5\).  Is this appearance deceiving?  Can we explain why this sequence should satisfy this recurrence?%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-126}
\hypertarget{p-929}{}%
Explain why \(a_n\) satisfies the recurrence \(a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}\).  You will need to use the graphs \(P_n\), \(P_{n-1}\) and \(P_{n-2}\) and their independent sets to do this.  Show how you can ``find'' the independent sets of \(P_{n-1}\) and \(P_{n-2}\) among the independent set of \(P_{n}\) (perhaps using some sort of bijection).%

Once we have a proof that our sequence really does give the answers to all the versions of the counting question we are interested in, then  we can start investigating properties of this sequence.  Sometimes, we might even be able to find a closed formula for the \(n\)th term of the sequence, so we can compute values without relying on the recurrence.%

Of course there is nothing special about 2 and 3 in the activities, so you should now see how to find the closed formula for any arithmetic or geometric sequence.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-968}{}%
The techniques used to get those closed formulas are also worth pointing out.  The method suggested in the hint to \hyperref[act-arithmetic]{Activity~\ref{act-arithmetic}} is called \terminology{telescoping} and the method suggested for \hyperref[act-geometric]{Activity~\ref{act-geometric}} is called \terminology{iteration}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-969}{}%
Most sequences are not arithmetic, but it is still helpful to look at the difference between terms.  Often if we know something about the sequence of differences, we can deduce something about the original sequence.   We can also think about this as starting with the sequence of differences.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-138}

Given any sequence \((a_n)_{n \ge 1}\), we can form the \terminology{sequence of partial sums} \((b_n)_{n \ge 1}\) given by \(b_n = \sum_{i = 1}^n a_n\).  That is, \(b_n\) tells you what you get if you add up the first \(n\) terms of \((a_n)\).%

The sequences in the previous activity worked out nicely, but what can we say in general?  Here are a few things.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-139}
\hypertarget{p-977}{}%
Let \((a_n)_{n \ge 1}\) be any arithmetic sequence.  Say \(a_n = dn + c\) (so \(d\) is the common difference and \(c = a_0\)).  What can we say about the closed formula for \(b_n = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i\)?%
\begin{enumerate}[font=\bfseries,label=(\alph*),ref=\alph*]
\item\label{task-180} \hypertarget{p-978}{}%
As an example, what is \(2+5+8+11+\cdots + 470\)?  You might call this sum \(S\) and calculate:%

\begin{tabular}{rccccccccc}
\(S  =\)&\(2\)&\(+\)&\(5\)&\(+\)&\(8\)&\(+ \cdots +\)&\(467\)&\(+\)&470\tabularnewline[0pt]

Why is that helpful?  What is the sum?%

\end{enumerate}
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-983}{}%
The previous activity shows that the sequence of partial sums of an arithmetic sequence is always a quadratic sequence.  Conversely, any quadratic sequence should arise in this way.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-140}
\hypertarget{p-984}{}%
Given a sequence \((b_n)_{n \ge 1}\) with a quadratic closed formula, say \(b_n = an^2 + bn + c\), what will the closed formula for the sequence of differences be?  That is, what is the closed formula for \(a_n = b_n - b_{n-1}\)?  Why does this show that every quadratic sequence is the sequence of partial sums for some arithmetic sequence?%
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-985}{}%
It is helpful to have a guess for the \emph{form} of a closed formula.  For example, if you believe that a sequence should have a closed formula that is say a cubic polynomial, then you can find a cubic polynomial that agrees with the first 4 terms of the sequence.  This would be done by setting up a system of 4 equations with 4 unknowns and solving the system.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-986}{}%
Another time this guess-and-check approach is reasonable is when we believe a sequence to be exponential.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-141}
\hypertarget{p-987}{}%
Consider the recurrence relation \(a_n = 5a_{n-1} - 6a_{n-2}\).%

\item\label{task-183} \hypertarget{p-988}{}%
Show that \(a_n = 2^n\) and \(a_n = 3^n\) are both solutions to the recurrence relation.  That is, they are sequences for which the recurrence relation holds.%

Show that if \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are any constants, \(a_n = \alpha 2^n + \beta 3^n\) is also a solution to the recurrence relation.%
\item\label{task-185} \hypertarget{p-991}{}%
Might there be another solution to the recurrence relation?  Suppose \(a_n = r^n\) for some non-zero constant \(r\).  Show that \(r = 2\) or \(r = 3\).%

\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-993}{}%
This is a partial justification of the \terminology{characteristic root technique} (the polynomial whose roots are the base of the exponentials is called the \terminology{characteristic polynomial}).  Making the reasonable guess that recurrence relations which give \(a_n\) as a linear combination of \(a_{n-1}\) and \(a_{n-2}\) should have exponential closed formulas allows you to find the bases of those exponentials.  You can then use the initial conditions to find the constants \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\).%

The sequences of paths and movie theater lines from \hyperref[act-pathshdseq]{Activity~\ref{act-pathshdseq}} are called \terminology{Dyck words}.  These are strings of an equal number of two symbols, say \(x\) and \(y\), such that no initial segment of the string has more \(y\)'s than \(x\)'s.%

The combinatorics we have investigated so far has been \emph{nice}.  While not always immediately obvious, each problem had an answer in a nice form that, once you saw how to think about it the right way, could be expressed with a closed formula.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1101}{}%
Not all of combinatorics is like this.  There are natural questions for which we do not have neat closed formulas.

The plan for this chapter is as follows.  We will begin by considering some natural extensions of distribution problems first introduced in \hyperref[sec_basic-quotient]{Section~\ref{sec_basic-quotient}}: partitioning sets and integers.  Motivated by these and similar problems, we will consider two combinatorial tools: generating functions and the Principle of Inclusion Exclusion.  We will then take a closer look at partitioning sets and integers with these new tools in hand.%

\hypertarget{p-1104}{}%
In \hyperref[sec_basic-quotient]{Section~\ref{sec_basic-quotient}} we considered some ways to distribute items to recipients.  Most basic counting formulas can be thought of as counting the number of ways to distribute either distinct or identical items to distinct recipients.  For example, distributing \(k\) distinct items to \(n\) distinct recipients can be done in \(n^k\) ways, if recipients can receive any number of items, or \(P(n,k)\) ways if recipients can receive at most one item.  If the items are identical, the corresponding number of ways to distribute them are \(\mchoose{n}{k}\) and \(\binom{n}{k}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1105}{}%
What if the recipients are not distinct?  Say we wish to distribute \(k\) books (either distinct or identical) to \(n\) identical boxes.  This is a perfectly natural extension, but we will see the answer is not.  First, let's get a feel for what this might look like for some small values of \(k\) and \(n\).%

\hypertarget{p-1114}{}%
Recall that a \terminology{partition} of a set \(A\) is a set of subsets of \(A\) such that every element of \(A\) is in exactly one of the subsets.  Sometimes we will call the subsets that make up a partition \terminology{blocks}.%
\begin{definition}[{}]\label{def-stirling}
\hypertarget{p-1115}{}%
Denote by \(S(k,n)\) the number of partitions of \([k]\) into exactly \(n\) subsets.  We call \(S(k,n)\) a \terminology{Stirling number (of the second kind)}.%
\end{definition}
\hypertarget{p-1116}{}%
Note that we write \(S(k,n)\) instead of \(S(n,k)\) here because we try to use \(k\) for the number of elements being distributed and \(n\) for the number of recipients.  When other books use \(S(n,k)\), they mean the number of partitions of \([n]\) into exactly \(k\) blocks.  This is the same definition as we give, but with renamed variables, formulas might look different.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1117}{}%
For example, consider how to partition \([3]\) into exactly two sets:%
\begin{equation*}
\{1,2\}, \{3\} \qquad \qquad \{1,3\},\{2\} \qquad \qquad \{2,3\},\{1\}
\end{equation*}
and that is all, so \(S(3,2) = 3\).  We do not care about the order the elements appear in each block, nor the order in which the blocks appear.  Thus we see the Stirling numbers count the number of ways to distribute \(k\) distinct items to \(n\) identical recipients so that each recipient gets at least one item.%

A multiset of positive integers that add to \(n\) is called a \terminology{partition}\index{partition of an integer} of \(n\). Thus the partitions of 3 are 1+1+1, 1+2 (which is the same as 2+1) and 3. The number of partitions of \(k\) is denoted by \(p(k)\); in computing the partitions of 3 we showed that \(p(3) = 3\). It is traditional to use Greek letters like \(\lambda\) to stand for partitions; we might write \(\lambda = 1,1,1\), \(\gamma= 2,1\) and \(\tau = 3\) to stand for the three partitions we just described. We also write \(\lambda = 1^3\) as a shorthand for \(\lambda = 1,1,1\), and we write \(\lambda \dashv 3\) as a shorthand for ``\(\lambda\) is a partition of three.''%

When we write a partition as \(\lambda = \lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_n\), it is customary to write the list of \(\lambda_i\)s as a decreasing list. When we have a type vector \((t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_m)\) for a partition, we write either \(\lambda = 1^{t_1}2^{t_2}\cdots m^{t_m}\) or \(\lambda = m^{t_m}(m-1)^{t_{m-1}}\cdots 2^{t_2}1^{t_1}\). Henceforth we will use the second of these. When we write \(\lambda=\lambda_1^{i_1}\lambda_2^{i_2}\cdots\lambda_n^{i_n}\), we will assume that \(\lambda_i>\lambda_i+1\).%

\hypertarget{p-1180}{}%
The decreasing list representation of partitions leads us to a handy way to visualize partitions. Given a decreasing list \((\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots \lambda_n)\), we draw a figure made up of rows of dots that has \(\lambda_1\) equally spaced dots in the first row, \(\lambda_2\) equally spaced dots in the second row, starting out right below the beginning of the first row and so on. Equivalently, instead of dots, we may use identical squares, drawn so that a square touches each one to its immediate right or immediately below it along an edge. See \hyperref[FerrersYoung]{Figure~\ref{FerrersYoung}} for examples.\index{Ferrers diagram}\index{Young diagram}\index{partition of an integer!Ferrers diagram}\index{partition of an integer!Young diagram}\index{diagram!of a partition!Ferrers}\index{diagram!of a partition!Young} The figure we draw with dots is called the \terminology{Ferrers diagram} of the partition; sometimes the figure with squares is also called a Ferrers diagram; sometimes it is called a \terminology{Young diagram}. At this stage it is irrelevant which name we choose and which kind of figure we draw; in more advanced work the squares are handy because we can put things like numbers or variables into them.  From now on we will use squares and call the diagrams Young diagrams.%

With the binomial coefficients, with Stirling numbers of the second kind, and with the Lah numbers, we were able to find a recurrence by asking what happens to our subset, partition, or broken permutation of a set \(S\) of numbers if we remove the largest element of \(S\). Thus it is natural to look for a recurrence to count the number of partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts by doing something similar. Unfortunately, since we are counting distributions in which all the objects are identical, there is no way for us to identify a largest element. However if we think geometrically, we can ask what we could remove from a Young diagram to get a Young diagram. Two natural ways to get a partition of a smaller integer from a partition of \(n\) would be to remove the top row of the Young diagram of the partition and to remove the left column of the Young diagram of the partition. These two operations correspond to removing the largest part from the partition and to subtracting 1 from each part of the partition respectively. Even though these have some sort of geometric symmetry, the two operations are not symmetric with respect to the number of parts. Thus one might be much more useful than the other for finding a recurrence for the number of partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts.%

The last two questions are designed to get you thinking about how we can get a bijection between the set of partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts and some other set of partitions that are partitions of a smaller number.  These questions describe two different strategies for getting that set of partitions of a smaller number or of smaller numbers.  Each strategy leads to a bijection between partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts and a set of partitions of a smaller number or numbers.  For each strategy, use the answers to the last two questions to find and describe this set of partitions into a smaller number and a bijection between partitions of \(k\) into \(n\) parts and partitions of the smaller integer or integers into appropriate numbers of parts.

Suppose you are going to choose three pieces of fruit from among apples, pears and bananas for a snack.  We can symbolically represent all your choices as%
\begin{equation*}
\ap\ap\ap+\pe\pe\pe+\ba\ba\ba+\ap\ap\pe+\ap\ap\ba+\ap\pe\pe +\pe\pe\ba
+\ap\ba\ba+\pe\ba\ba+\ap\pe\ba.
\end{equation*}
Here we are using a picture of a piece of fruit to stand for taking a piece of that fruit. Thus \(\ap\) stands for taking an apple, \(\ap\pe\) for taking an apple and a pear, and \(\ap\ap\) for taking two apples.  You can think of the plus sign as standing for the ``exclusive or,'' that is, \(\ap+\ba\) would stand for ``I take an apple or a banana but not both.'' To say ``I take both an apple and a banana,'' we would write \(\ap\ba\). We can extend the analogy to mathematical notation by condensing our statement that we take three pieces of fruit to%
\begin{equation*}
\ap^3+\pe^3+\ba^3+\ap^2\pe+\ap^2\ba +\ap\pe^2+\pe^2\ba+
\ap\ba^2+\pe\ba^2 +\ap\pe\ba.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1294}{}%
In this notation \(\ap^3\) stands for taking a multiset of three apples, while \(\ap^2\ba\) stands for taking a multiset of two apples and a banana, and so on. What our notation is really doing is giving us a convenient way to list all three element multisets chosen from the set \(\{\ap,\pe,\ba\}\).\footnote{This approach was inspired by George Pólya's paper ``Picture Writing,'' in the December, 1956 issue of the \textsl{American Mathematical Monthly}, page 689. While we are taking a somewhat more formal approach than Pólya, it is still completely in the spirit of his work.\label{fn-13}}%

Suppose now that we plan to choose between one and three apples, between one and two pears, and between one and two bananas. In a somewhat clumsy way we could describe our fruit selections as%

(You may use pictures instead of letters if you prefer, but it gets tedious quite quickly!) Now expand the product \((A+A^2+A^3)(P+P^2)(B+B^2)\) and compare the result with your formula.%

If we were to expand the formula%

Thus \hyperref[uptothreefruits]{Formula~(\ref{uptothreefruits})} and \hyperref[threefruitsagain]{Formula~(\ref{threefruitsagain})} each describe the number of multisets we can choose from the set \(\{\ap,\pe,\ba\}\) in which \(\apple\)~appears between 1 and three times and \(\pear\) and \(\banana\)~each appear once or twice. We interpret \hyperref[uptothreefruits]{Formula~(\ref{uptothreefruits})} as describing each individual multiset we can choose, and we interpret \hyperref[threefruitsagain]{Formula~(\ref{threefruitsagain})} as saying that we first decide how many apples to take, and then decide how many pears to take, and then decide how many bananas to take. At this stage it might seem a bit magical that doing ordinary algebra with the second formula yields the first, but in fact we could define addition and multiplication with these pictures more formally so we could explain in detail why things work out. However since the pictures are for motivation, and are actually difficult to write out on paper, it doesn't make much sense to work out these details. We will see an explanation in another context later on.%

\hypertarget{p-1302}{}%
As you've seen, in our descriptions of ways of choosing fruits, we've treated the pictures of the fruit as if they are variables. You've also likely noticed that it is much easier to do algebraic manipulations with letters rather than pictures, simply because it is time consuming to draw the same picture over and over again, while we are used to writing letters quickly. In the theory of generating functions, we associate variables or polynomials or even power series with members of a set. There is no standard language describing how we associate variables with members of a set, so we shall invent\footnote{We are really adapting language introduced by George Pólya.\label{fn-14}} some. By a \terminology{picture} of a member of a set we will mean a variable, or perhaps a product of powers of variables (or even a sum of products of powers of variables). A function that assigns a picture \(P(s)\) to each member \(s\) of a set \(S\) will be called a \terminology{picture function} . The \terminology{picture enumerator}\index{picture enumerator} for a picture function \(P\) defined on a set \(S\) will be%
\begin{equation*}
E_P(S) = \sum_{s: s\in S}  P(s).
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1303}{}%
We choose this language because the picture enumerator lists, or enumerates, all the elements of \(S\) according to their pictures. Thus \hyperref[uptothreefruits]{Formula~(\ref{uptothreefruits})} is the picture enumerator the set of all multisets of fruit with between one and three apples, one and two pears, and one and two bananas.%

Notice that when we used \(A^2\) to stand for taking two apples, and \(P^3\) to stand for taking three pears, then we used the product \(A^2P^3\) to stand for taking two apples and three pears. Thus we have chosen the picture of the ordered pair (2 apples, 3 pears) to be the product of the pictures of a multiset of two apples and a multiset of three pears. Show that if \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) are sets with picture functions \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) defined on them, and if we define the picture of an ordered pair \((x_1,x_2)\in S_1\times S_2\) to be \(P((x_1,x_2))= P_1(x_1)P_2(x_2)\), then the picture enumerator of \(P\) on the set \(S_1\times S_2\) is \(E_{P_1}(S_1)E_{P_2}(S_2)\).

In \hyperref[reprovingbinomialtheorem]{Activity~\ref{reprovingbinomialtheorem}} we see that we can think of the process of expanding the polynomial \((1+x)^n\) as a way of ``generating'' the binomial coefficients \(\binom{n}{k}\) as the coefficients of \(x^k\) in the expansion of \((1+x)^n\). For this reason, we say that \((1+x)^n\) is the ``generating function'' for the binomial coefficients \(\binom{n}{k}\). More generally, the \terminology{generating function} for a sequence \(a_i\), defined for \(i\) with \(0\le i\le n\) is the expression \(\sum_{i=0}^n a_ix^i\), and the \terminology{generating function}\index{generating function} for the sequence \(a_i\) with \(i\ge 0\) is the expression \(\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_ix^i\). This last expression is an example of a power series. In calculus it is important to think about whether a power series converges in order to determine whether or not it represents a function. In a nice twist of language, even though we use the phrase generating function as the name of a power series in combinatorics, we don't require the power series to actually represent a function in the usual sense, and so we don't have to worry about convergence.\footnote{In the evolution of our current mathematical terminology, the word function evolved through several meanings, starting with very imprecise meanings and ending with our current rather precise meaning.  The terminology ``generating function'' may be thought of as an example of one of the earlier usages of the term function.\label{fn-15}} Instead we think of a power series as a convenient way of representing the terms of a sequence of numbers of interest to us. The only justification for saying that such a representation is convenient is because of the way algebraic properties of power series capture some of the important properties of some sequences that are of combinatorial importance. The remainder of this chapter is devoted to giving examples of how the algebra of power series reflects combinatorial ideas.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1322}{}%
Because we choose to think of power series as strings of symbols that we manipulate by using the ordinary rules of algebra and we choose to ignore issues of convergence, we have to avoid manipulating power series in a way that would require us to add infinitely many real numbers. For example, we cannot make the substitution of \(y+1\) for \(x\) in the power series \(\sum_{i=0}^\infty x^i\), because in order to interpret \(\sum_{i=0}^\infty (y+1)^i\) as a power series we would have to apply the binomial theorem to each of the \((y+1)^i\) terms, and then collect like terms, giving us infinitely many ones added together as the coefficient of \(y^0\), and in fact infinitely many numbers added together for the coefficient of any~\(y^i\). (On the other hand, it would be fine to substitute \(y+y^2\) for \(x\). Can you see why?)%

Each time that we converted a picture function to a generating function by substituting \(x\) or some power of \(x\) for each picture, the coefficient of \(x\) had a meaning that was significant to us. For example, with the picture enumerator for selecting between zero and three each of apples, pears, and bananas, when we substituted \(x\) for each of our pictures, the exponent \(i\) in the power \(x^i\) is the number of pieces of fruit in the fruit selection that led us to \(x^i\). After we simplify our product by collecting together all like powers of \(x\), the coefficient of \(x^i\) is the number of fruit selections that use \(i\) pieces of fruit. In the same way, if we substitute \(x^c\) for a picture, where \(c\) is the number of calories in that particular kind of fruit, then the \(i\) in an \(x^i\) term in our generating function stands for the number of calories in a fruit selection that gave rise to \(x^i\), and the coefficient of \(x^i\) in our generating function is the number of fruit selections with \(i\) calories.  The product principle of picture enumerators translates directly into a product principle for generating functions.%

Recall that a recurrence relation for a sequence \(a_n\) expresses \(a_n\) in terms of values \(a_i\) for \(i\lt n\). For example, the equation \(a_i=3a_{i-1} +2^i\) is a first order linear constant coefficient recurrence.%

Multiply both sides by \(x^i\) and sum both the left hand side and right hand side from \(i=1\) to infinity.  In the left-hand side use the fact that%

Let's take a closer look at the Stirling numbers, first introduced in \hyperref[sec_adv-partitions]{Section~\ref{sec_adv-partitions}}.

\par
\hypertarget{p-1433}{}%
Directly from the definition, we see that \(S(k,1) = 1\) and \(S(k,k) = 1\).  From these we can compute the remaining Stirling numbers using the recursion%
\begin{equation*}
S(k,n) = nS(k-1,n) + S(k-1, n-1).
\end{equation*}
This recursion is justified by dividing the partitions of \([k]\) into those which contain \(k\) as a singleton set (there are \(S(k-1, n-1)\) of these) and those that don't (there are \(n\) choices for where \(k\) could for each of the \(S(k-1, n)\) partitions of \([k-1]\) into \(n\) blocks).%

In how many ways may we label the elements of a \(k\)-element set with \(n\) distinct labels (numbered 1 through \(n\)) so that label \(i\) is used \(j_i\) times? (If we think of the labels as \(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n\), then we can rephrase this question as follows.  How many functions are there from a \(k\)-element set \(K\) to a set \(N=\{y_1,y_2,\ldots y_n\}\) so that \(y_i\) is the image of \(j_i\) elements of \(K\)?) This number is called a \terminology{multinomial coefficient}\index{multinomial coefficient}\index{coefficient!multinomial} and denoted by%

\section[{Bell Numbers}]{Bell Numbers}\label{sec_adv-bell}
\hypertarget{p-1508}{}%
The Bell number, \(B_{k}\), denotes the number of ways that a set of \(k\) objects can be partitioned into nonempty subsets. We have already seen how to partition a set of \(k\) objects into exactly \(n\) subsets: \(S(k,n)\).  So on its face, \(B_k = \sum_{n=1}^kS(k,n)\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1509}{}%
The sequence of Bell numbers starts%
\begin{equation*}
1, 1, 2, 5, 15, 52, 203, 877, 4040, 21147, 115975, \ldots
\end{equation*}
Notice that the first four numbers look like Catalan numbers.  In fact, one of the many things the Catalan numbers count are \emph{non-intersecting} set partitions.  Once you believe this, you see that \(C_n \le B_n\) for all \(n\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1510}{}%
The Bell numbers can be generated by constructing what is called the Bell Triangle. To construct this triangle, begin with a 1 at the top and a 1 below it. Add these two numbers together and put the sum 2, to the right of the 1 in the second column. This 2 is also the first entry of the third row. The second entry in the third row is found by adding the 2 to the number 1 above it. This sum is 3 and goes to the right of the 2. The 3 is now below a 2. Adding these two numbers produces the last number, 5, in the third row. Since 5 has no number above it, the third row is complete. 5 now becomes the first number in the fourth row and the process continues.%

To summarize, construction of the triangle follows two basic rules: \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-55}{}\hypertarget{p-1512}{}%
The last number of each row is the first number of the next row.%
\item\hypertarget{li-56}{}\hypertarget{p-1513}{}%
All other numbers are found by adding the number to the left of the missing number to the number directly above this same number.%
\end{enumerate}
 When the triangle is extended, as above, the Bell Numbers are found down the first column as well as along the outside diagonal.%

As with Pascal's Triangle, the Bell triangle has several interesting properties.%
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-291}
\hypertarget{p-1516}{}%
If the sum of a row is added to the Bell number at the end of that row, the next Bell number is obtained. For example, the sum of the fourth row plus the Bell number at the end of the row: \(15 + 20 + 27 + 37 + 52 + 52\) is 203, the next Bell number.  Why does this happen?%

\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-1518}{}%
Rotating the triangle slightly creates a \emph{difference} triangle analogous to Pascal's Triangle. The entries that are formed recursively by adding in Pascal's Triangle are now differences of the two numbers above them in the Bell triangle.%

This pattern suggests the \({(n + 1)}^{\text{th}}\) Bell Number can be represented recursively by \(B_{n + 1} = \binom{n}{0} B_{0} + \binom{n}{1} B_{1} + \binom{n}{2}B_{2} + \ldots + \binom{n}{n} B_{n}\). The coefficients of this equation are the entries of the \(n\)th row of Pascal's triangle.%

Prove the recurrence%
\begin{equation*}
B_{k + 1} = \binom{k}{0} B_{0} + \binom{k}{1} B_{1} + \binom{k}{2}B_{2} + \ldots + \binom{k}{k} B_{k}
\end{equation*}
%
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-1523}{}%
The Bell numbers are related to the Stirling numbers and can be defined as the sum of the Stirling numbers of the second kind. That is, \(B_{k} = S(k,1) + S(k,2) + \cdots + S(k,k)\), where \(S(k,n)\) represents the number of ways of grouping \(k\) elements into \(n\) subsets. So \(B_{3} = S(3,1) + S(3,2) + S(3,3) = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5\). Since the Bell numbers count the partitions of a set of elements, they are used in prime-number theory to enumerate the number of ways to factor a number with distinct prime factors. For example, 42 has three distinct prime factors: 2, 3, and 7. Since \(B_{3} = 5\) , we know there are five ways of factoring 42. These are \(2 \times 3 \times 7\), \(2 \times 21\), \(3 \times 14\), \(6 \times 7\), and \(42\). So the number \(210\), which has 4 distinct factors, 2, 3, 5, and 7, can be factored in \(B_{4} = 15\) ways.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1524}{}%
The Bell numbers can be used to model many real-life situations. For example, the number of different ways two people can sleep in unlabeled twin beds is \(B_{2} = 2\) ways: They can sleep in the same bed or in separate beds. The number of ways of serving a dinner consisting of three items, such as a salad, bread, and fish is \(B_{3} = 5\) ways: each could be served on a separate plate, salad and bread could be on one plate and fish on another, salad and fish on one plate and bread on another, or all three items could be on the same plate. This example serves as a model for the five ways three people can occupy three unlabeled beds, the five ways three prisoners can be handcuffed together, the five ways three nations can be form alliances, or any situation of partitioning three distinct elements into non-empty subsets.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1525}{}%
One interesting application of Bell numbers is in counting the number of rhyme schemes possible for a stanza in poetry. There are \(B_{2} = 2\) possibilities for a two-line stanza: the lines can either rhyme or not rhyme. The possible rhyme schemes of a three-line stanza can be described as aaa, aab, aba, abb, and abc: thus there are 5 or \(B_{3}\) possible rhyme schemes. The Japanese used diagrams depicting possible rhyme schemes of a five-line stanza \(B_{5} = 52\) as early as 1000 A.D. in the \emph{Tale of the Genji} by Lady Shikibu Murasaki.%

The very interesting history of the theory of linear partitions dates back to the Middle Ages, where certain special problems in partitions were encountered.  The first major discoveries were made by L. Euler in the 18th century, followed by contributions by Cayley, Gauss, Hardy, Jacobi, Lagrange, Legendre, Littlewoood, Rademacher, Ramanujan, Schur, and Sylvester.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1535}{}%
Our history with linear partitions started in \hyperref[sec_adv-partitions]{Section~\ref{sec_adv-partitions}}.  Recall that a partition of the number \(k\) is a tuple of positive integers \(\lambda = (\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n)\) such that \(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 + \cdots + \lambda_n = k\) and \(\lambda_1 \ge \lambda_2 \ge \cdots \ge \lambda_n\).  Taking the terms in the sum to be non-increasing is our way of ensuring that we do not count one partition listed in a different order twice.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1536}{}%
We use \(p(k)\) for the number of partitions of \(k\), and \(p_n(k)\) for the number of partitions of \(k\) into exactly \(n\) parts.  The sequence \((p(k))_{k \ge 1}\) starts,%
\begin{equation*}
1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 22,\ldots
\end{equation*}
We can use a recurrence relation for \(p_n(k) = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i(k-n)\) (see \hyperref[numberpartitionrecurrence]{Activity~\ref{numberpartitionrecurrence}}) to give us a triangle of values for \(p_n(k)\), which starts,%

The idea of conjugation of a partition could be defined without the geometric interpretation of a Young diagram, but it would seem far less natural without the geometric interpretation. Another idea that seems much more natural in a geometric context is this. Suppose we have a partition of \(k\) into \(n\) parts with largest part \(m\). Then the Young diagram of the partition can fit into a rectangle that is \(m\) or more units wide (horizontally) and \(n\) or more units deep. Suppose we place the Young diagram of our partition in the top left-hand corner of an \(m'\) unit wide and \(n'\) unit deep rectangle with \(m'\ge m\) and \(n' \ge n\), as in \hyperref[complementpartition]{Figure~\ref{complementpartition}}.%

In \hyperref[change-making]{Activity~\ref{change-making}} we found the generating function for the number of partitions of an integer into parts of size 1, 5, 10, and 25. When working with generating functions for partitions, it is becoming standard to use \(q\) rather than \(x\) as the variable in the generating function.  Write your answers in this notation.\footnote{The reason for this change in the notation relates to the subject of finite fields in abstract algebra, where \(q\) is the standard notation for the size of a finite field.  While we will make no use of this connection, it will be easier for you to read more advanced work if you get used to the different notation.\label{fn-20}}%

In order to \emph{do} mathematics, we must be able to \emph{talk} and \emph{write} about mathematics. Perhaps your experience with mathematics so far has mostly involved finding answers to problems. As we embark towards more advanced and abstract mathematics, writing will play a more prominent role in the mathematical process.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1780}{}%
Communication in mathematics requires more precision than many other subjects, and thus we should take a few pages here to consider the basic building blocks: \emph{mathematical statements}.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection B.1.1 Atomic and Molecular Statements}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{Atomic and Molecular Statements}]{Atomic and Molecular Statements}\label{atomic-molecular-statements}
\hypertarget{p-1781}{}%
A \terminology{statement}\index{statement} is any declarative sentence which is either true or false. A statement is \terminology{atomic} if it cannot be divided into smaller statements, otherwise it is called \terminology{molecular}.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-10}
\hypertarget{p-1782}{}%
These are statements (in fact, \emph{atomic} statements): \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1783}{}%
Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1784}{}%
The moon is made of cheese.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1785}{}%
42 is a perfect square.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1786}{}%
Every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1787}{}%
\(3+7 = 12\)%
\end{itemize}
 And these are not statements: \leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1788}{}%
Would you like some cake?%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1789}{}%
The sum of two squares.%
\item{}\(1+3+5+7+\cdots+2n+1\).%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1790}{}%
Go to your room!%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1791}{}%
\(3+x = 12\)%
\end{itemize}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-1792}{}%
The reason the sentence ``\(3 + x = 12\)'' is not a statement is that it contains a variable. Depending on what \(x\) is, the sentence is either true or false, but right now it is neither. One way to make the \emph{sentence} into a \emph{statement} is to specify the value of the variable in some way. This could be done by specifying a specific substitution, for example, ``\(3+x = 12\) where \(x = 9\),'' which is a true statement.  Or you could \emph{capture} the free varialbe by \emph{quantifying} over it, as in, ``for all values of \(x\), \(3+x = 12\),'' which is false. We will discuss quantifiers in more detail at the end of this section.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1793}{}%
You can build more complicated (molecular) statements out of simpler (atomic or molecular) ones using \terminology{logical connectives} \index{connectives}. For example, this is a molecular statement:%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-4}{}
\hypertarget{p-1794}{}%
Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits and 42 is a perfect square.%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-1795}{}%
Note that we can break this down into two smaller statements. The two shorter statements are \emph{connected} by an ``and.'' We will consider 5 connectives: ``and'' (Sam is a man and Chris is a woman), ``or'' (Sam is a man or Chris is a woman), ``if\textellipsis{}, then\textellipsis{}'' (if Sam is a man, then Chris is a woman), ``if and only if'' (Sam is a man if and only if Chris is a woman), and ``not'' (Sam is not a man). The first four are called \terminology{binary connectives} (because they connect two statements) while ``not'' is an example of a \terminology{unary connective} (since it applies to a single statement).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1796}{}%
These molecular statements are of course still statements, so they must be either true or false.  The absolutely key observation here is that which \terminology{truth value} \index{truth value} the molecular statement achieves is completely determined by the type of connective and the truth values of the parts. We do not need to know what the parts actually say, only whether those parts are true or false. So to analyze logical connectives, it is enough to consider \terminology{propositional variables} (sometimes called \emph{sentential} variables), usually capital letters in the middle of the alphabet: \(P, Q, R, S, \ldots\).  We think of these as standing in for (usually atomic) statements, but there are only two \emph{values} the variables can achieve: true or false.\footnote{In computer programing, we would call such variables \terminology{Boolean variables}.\label{fn-21}} \label{notation-9}
 We also have symbols for the logical connectives: \(\wedge\), \(\vee\), \(\imp\), \(\iff\), \(\neg\).%
\begin{assemblage}[Logical Connectives]\label{assemblage-7}
\hypertarget{p-1797}{}%
\leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\(P \wedge Q\) is read ``\(P\) and \(Q\),'' and called a \terminology{conjunction}. \index{conjunction} \index{connectives!and}\label{notation-10}
%
\item{}\(P \vee Q\) is read ``\(P\) or \(Q\),'' and called a \terminology{disjunction}. \index{disjunction} \index{connectives!or}\label{notation-11}
%
\item{}\(P \imp Q\) is read ``if \(P\) then \(Q\),'' and called an \terminology{implication} or \terminology{conditional}. \index{implication} \index{conditional} \index{connectives!implies} \index{if\textellipsis{}, then\textellipsis{}}%
\item{}\(P \iff Q\) is read ``\(P\) if and only if \(Q\),'' and called a \terminology{biconditional}. \index{biconditional} \index{connectives!if and only if} \index{if and only if}%
\item{}\(\neg P\) is read ``not \(P\),'' and called a \terminology{negation}. \index{negation} \index{connectives!not}\label{notation-12}
%
\end{itemize}
%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-1798}{}%
The \terminology{truth value} of a statement is determined by the truth value(s) of its part(s), depending on the connectives:%
\begin{assemblage}[Truth Conditions for Connectives]\label{assemblage-8}
\hypertarget{p-1799}{}%
\leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\(P \wedge Q\) is true when both \(P\) and \(Q\) are true%
\item{}\(P \vee Q\) is true when \(P\) or \(Q\) or both are true.%
\item{}\(P \imp Q\) is true when \(P\) is false or \(Q\) is true or both.%
\item{}\(P \iff Q\) is true when \(P\) and \(Q\) are both true, or both false.%
\item{}\(\neg P\) is true when \(P\) is false.%
\end{itemize}
%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-1800}{}%
Note that for us, \emph{or} is the \terminology{inclusive or} \index{inclusive or} (and not the sometimes used \emph{exclusive or}) meaning that \(P \vee Q\) is in fact true when both \(P\) and \(Q\) are true. As for the other connectives, ``and'' behaves as you would expect, as does negation. The biconditional (if and only if) might seem a little strange, but you should think of this as saying the two parts of the statements are \emph{equivalent} in that they have the same truth value. This leaves only the conditional \(P \imp Q\) which has a slightly different meaning in mathematics than it does in ordinary usage. However, implications are so common and useful in mathematics, that we must develop fluency with their use, and as such, they deserve their own subsection.%

\item{}\(P\) is the \terminology{hypothesis} (or \terminology{antecedent}).%
\item{}\(Q\) is the \terminology{conclusion} (or \terminology{consequent}).%

An implication is \emph{true} provided \(P\) is false or  \(Q\) is true (or both), and \emph{false} otherwise.  In particualr, the only way for \(P \imp Q\) to be false is for \(P\) to be true \emph{and} \(Q\) to be false.%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-1803}{}%
Easily the most common type of statement in mathematics is the implication. Even statements that do not at first look like they have this form conceal an implication at their heart. Consider the \emph{Pythagorean Theorem}. Many a college freshman would quote this theorem as ``\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).'' This is absolutely not correct. For one thing, that is not a statement since it has three variables in it. Perhaps they imply that this should be true for any values of the variables?  So \(1^2 + 5^2 = 2^2\)??? How can we fix this? Well, the equation is true as long as \(a\) and \(b\) are the legs or a right triangle and \(c\) is the hypotenuse. In other words:%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-5}{}
\hypertarget{p-1804}{}%
\emph{If} \(a\) and \(b\) are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse \(c\), \emph{then} \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-1805}{}%
This is a reasonable way to think about implications: our claim is that the conclusion (``then'' part) is true, but on the assumption that the hypothesis (``if'' part) is true. We make no claim about the conclusion in situations when the hypothesis is false.\footnote{However, note that in the case of the Pythagorean Theorem, it is also the case that \emph{if} \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\), \emph{then} \(a\) and \(b\) are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse \(c\).  So we could have also expressed this theorem as a biconditional: ``\(a\) and \(b\) are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse \(c\) \emph{if and only if} \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\).''\label{fn-22}}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1806}{}%
Still, it is important to remember that an implication is a statement, and therefore is either true or false. The truth value of the implication is determined by the truth values of its two parts. To agree with the usage above, we say that an implication is true either when the hypothesis is false, or when the conclusion is true. This leaves only one way for an implication to be false: when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-11}
\hypertarget{p-1807}{}%
Consider the statement:%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-6}{}
\hypertarget{p-1808}{}%
If Bob gets a 90 on the final, then Bob will pass the class.%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-1809}{}%
This is definitely an implication: \(P\) is the statement ``Bob gets a 90 on the final,'' and \(Q\) is the statement ``Bob will pass the class.''%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1810}{}%
Suppose I made that statement to Bob. In what circumstances would it be fair to call me a liar? What if Bob really did get a 90 on the final, and he did pass the class? Then I have not lied; my statement is true. However, if Bob did get a 90 on the final and did not pass the class, then I lied, making the statement false. The tricky case is this: what if Bob did not get a 90 on the final? Maybe he passes the class, maybe he doesn't. Did I lie in either case? I think not. In these last two cases, \(P\) was false, and the statement \(P \imp Q\) was true. In the first case, \(Q\) was true, and so was \(P \imp Q\). So \(P \imp Q\) is true when either \(P\) is false or \(Q\) is true.%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-1811}{}%
Just to be clear, although we sometimes read \(P \imp Q\) as ``\(P\) \emph{implies} \(Q\)'', we are not insisting that there is some causal relationship between the statements \(P\) and \(Q\). In particular, if you claim that \(P \imp Q\) is \emph{false}, you are not saying that \(P\) does not imply \(Q\), but rather that \(P\) is true and \(Q\) is false.%

\begin{enumerate}

Similarly here, regardless of the truth value of the hypothesis, the conclusion is true, making the implication true.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-1822}{}%
It is important to understand the conditions under which an implication is true not only to decide whether a mathematical statement is true, but in order to \emph{prove} that it is. Proofs might seem scary (especially if you have had a bad high school geometry experience) but all we are really doing is explaining (very carefully) why a statement is true. If you understand the truth conditions for an implication, you already have the outline for a proof.%
\begin{assemblage}[Direct Proofs of Implications]\label{assemblage-10}
\hypertarget{p-1823}{}%
To prove an implication \(P \imp Q\), it is enough to assume \(P\), and from it, deduce \(Q\).%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-1824}{}%
Perhaps a better way to say this is that to prove a statement of the form \(P \imp Q\) directly, you must explain why \(Q\) is true, but you \emph{get to} assume \(P\) is true first.  After all, you only care about whether \(Q\) is true in the case that \(P\) is as well.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1825}{}%
There are other techniques to prove statements (implications and others) that we will encounter throughout our studies, and new proof techniques are discovered all the time. Direct proof is the easiest and most elegant style of proof and has the advantage that such a proof often does a great job of explaining \emph{why} the statement is true.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-13}
\hypertarget{p-1826}{}%
Prove: If two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) are even, then their sum \(a+b\) is even.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-254}{}\quad%
\begin{proof}\hypertarget{proof-9}{}
\hypertarget{p-1827}{}%
Suppose the numbers \(a\) and \(b\) are even. This means that  \(a = 2k\) and \(b=2j\) for some integers \(k\) and \(j\). The sum is then \(a+b = 2k+2j = 2(k+j)\). Since \(k+j\) is an integer, this means that \(a+b\) is even.%
\end{proof}
\hypertarget{p-1828}{}%
Notice that since we get to assume the hypothesis of the implication we immediately have a place to start. The proof proceeds essentially by repeatedly asking and answering, ``what does that mean?''  Eventually, we conclude that the means the conclusion.%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-1829}{}%
This sort of argument shows up outside of math as well. If you ever found yourself starting an argument with ``hypothetically, let's assume \textellipsis{},'' then you have attempted a direct proof of your desired conclusion.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1830}{}%
An implication is a way of expressing a relationship between two statements.  It is often interesting to ask whether there are other relationships between the statements.  Here we introduce some common language to address this question.%
\begin{assemblage}[Converse and Contrapositive]\label{assemblage-11}
\hypertarget{p-1831}{}%
\leavevmode%
\begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet]
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1832}{}%
The \terminology{converse} \index{converse} of an implication \(P \imp Q\) is the implication \(Q \imp P\). The converse is NOT logically equivalent to the original implication.  That is, whether the converse of an implication is true is independent of the truth of the implication.%
\item{}\hypertarget{p-1833}{}%
The \terminology{contrapositive} \index{contrapositive} of an implication \(P \imp Q\) is the statement \(\neg Q \imp \neg P\). An implication and its contrapositive are logically equivalent (they are either both true or both false).%
\end{itemize}
%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-1834}{}%
Mathematics is overflowing with examples of true implications which have a false converse. If a number greater than 2 is prime, then that number is odd. However, just because a number is odd does not mean it is prime. If a shape is a square, then it is a rectangle. But it is false that if a shape is a rectangle, then it is a square. While this happens often, it does not always happen. For example, the Pythagorean theorem has a true converse: if\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\), then the triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is a \emph{right} triangle. Whenever you encounter an implication in mathematics, it is always reasonable to ask whether the converse is true.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1835}{}%
The contrapositive, on the other hand, always has the same truth value as its original implication. This can be very helpful in deciding whether an implication is true: often it is easier to analyze the contrapositive.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-14}
\hypertarget{p-1836}{}%
True or false: If you draw any nine playing cards from a regular deck, then you will have at least three cards all of the same suit. Is the converse true?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-255}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-1837}{}%
True. The original implication is a little hard to analyze because there are so many different combinations of nine cards. But consider the contrapositive: If you \emph{don't} have at least three cards all of the same suit, then you don't have nine cards. It is easy to see why this is true: you can at most have two cards of each of the four suits, for a total of eight cards (or fewer).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1838}{}%
The converse: If you have at least three cards all of the same suit, then you have nine cards. This is false. You could have three spades and nothing else. Note that to demonstrate that the converse (an implication) is false, we provided an example where the hypothesis is true (you do have three cards of the same suit), but where the conclusion is false (you do not have nine cards).%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-1839}{}%
Understanding converses and contrapositives can help understand implications and their truth values:%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-15}
\hypertarget{p-1840}{}%
Suppose I tell Sue that if she gets a 93\% on her final, then she will get an A in the class. Assuming that what I said is true, what can you conclude in the following cases:%

\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-130}{}\hypertarget{p-1842}{}%

\item\hypertarget{li-131}{}\hypertarget{p-1843}{}%
Sue gets an A in the class.%
\item\hypertarget{li-132}{}\hypertarget{p-1844}{}%
Sue does not get a 93\% on her final.%
\item\hypertarget{li-133}{}\hypertarget{p-1845}{}%
Sue does not get an A in the class.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-256}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-1846}{}%
Note first that whenever \(P \imp Q\) and \(P\) are both true statements, \(Q\) must be true as well. For this problem, take \(P\) to mean ``Sue gets a 93\% on her final'' and \(Q\) to mean ``Sue will get an A in the class.''%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1847}{}%
\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-134}{}\hypertarget{p-1848}{}%
We have \(P \imp Q\) and \(P\), so \(Q\) follows. Sue gets an A.%
\item\hypertarget{li-135}{}\hypertarget{p-1849}{}%
You cannot conclude anything. Sue could have gotten the A because she did extra credit for example. Notice that we do not know that if Sue gets an \(A\), then she gets a 93\% on her final. That is the converse of the original implication, so it might or might not be true.%
\item\hypertarget{li-136}{}\hypertarget{p-1850}{}%
The contrapositive of the converse of \(P \imp Q\) is \(\neg P \imp \neg Q\), which states that if Sue does not get a 93\% on the final, then she will not get an A in the class. But this does not follow from the original implication. Again, we can conclude nothing. Sue could have done extra credit.%
\item\hypertarget{li-137}{}\hypertarget{p-1851}{}%
What would happen if Sue does not get an A but \emph{did} get a 93\% on the final? Then \(P\) would be true and \(Q\) would be false. This makes the implication \(P \imp Q\) false! It must be that Sue did not get a 93\% on the final. Notice now we have the implication \(\neg Q \imp \neg P\) which is the contrapositive of \(P \imp Q\). Since \(P \imp Q\) is assumed to be true, we know \(\neg Q \imp \neg P\) is true as well.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-1852}{}%
As we said above, an implication is not logically equivalent to its converse, but it is possible that both the implication and its converse are true. In this case, when both \(P \imp Q\) and \(Q \imp P\) are true, we say that \(P\) and \(Q\) are equivalent and write \(P \iff Q\). This is the biconditional we mentioned earlier.%
\begin{assemblage}[If and only if]\label{assemblage-12}
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-7}{}
\hypertarget{p-1853}{}%
\(P \iff Q\) is logically equivalent to \((P \imp Q) \wedge (Q \imp P)\).%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-1854}{}%
Example: Given an integer \(n\), it is true that \(n\) is even if and only if \(n^2\) is even. That is, if \(n\) is even, then \(n^2\) is even, as well as the converse: if \(n^2\) is even, then \(n\) is even.%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-1855}{}%
You can think of ``if and only if'' statements as having two parts: an implication and its converse. We might say one is the ``if'' part, and the other is the ``only if'' part. We also sometimes say that ``if and only if'' statements have two directions: a forward direction \((P \imp Q)\) and a backwards direction (\(P \leftarrow Q\), which is really just sloppy notation for \(Q \imp P\)).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1856}{}%
Let's think a little about which part is which. Is \(P \imp Q\) the ``if'' part or the ``only if'' part? Consider an example.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-16}
\hypertarget{p-1857}{}%
Suppose it is true that I sing if and only if I'm in the shower. We know this means both that if I sing, then I'm in the shower, and also the converse, that if I'm in the shower, then I sing. Let \(P\) be the statement, ``I sing,'' and \(Q\) be, ``I'm in the shower.'' So \(P \imp Q\) is the statement ``if I sing, then I'm in the shower.'' Which part of the if and only if statement is this?%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1858}{}%
What we are really asking for is the meaning of ``I sing \emph{if} I'm in the shower'' and ``I sing \emph{only if} I'm in the shower.'' When is the first one (the ``if'' part) \emph{false}? When I am in the shower but not singing. That is the same condition on being false as the statement ``if I'm in the shower, then I sing.'' So the ``if'' part is \(Q \imp P\). On the other hand, to say, ``I sing only if I'm in the shower'' is equivalent to saying ``if I sing, then I'm in the shower,'' so the ``only if'' part is \(P \imp Q\).%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-1859}{}%
It is not terribly important to know which part is the ``if'' or ``only if'' part, but this does illustrate something very, very important: \emph{there are many ways to state an implication!}%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-17}
\hypertarget{p-1860}{}%

Recall from calculus, if a function is differentiable at a point \(c\), then it is continuous at \(c\), but that the converse of this statement is not true (for example, \(f(x) = |x|\) at the point 0). Restate this fact using ``necessary and sufficient'' language.%

Thinking about the necessity and sufficiency of conditions can also help when writing proofs and justifying conclusions. If you want to establish some mathematical fact, it is helpful to think what other facts would \emph{be enough} (be sufficient) to prove your fact. If you have an assumption, think about what must also be necessary if that hypothesis is true.%

It would be nice to use variables in our mathematical sentences. For example, suppose we wanted to claim that if \(n\) is prime, then \(n+7\) is not prime. This looks like an implication. I would like to write something like%
\begin{equation*}
P(n) \imp \neg P(n+7) 
\end{equation*}
where \(P(n)\) means ``\(n\) is prime.'' But this is not quite right. For one thing, because this sentence has a \terminology{free variable} (that is, a variable that we have not specified anything about), it is not a statement. Now, if we plug in a specific value for \(n\), we do get a statement. In fact, it turns out that no matter what value we plug in for \(n\), we get a true implication. What we really want to say is that \emph{for all} values of \(n\), if \(n\) is prime, then \(n+7\) is not. We need to \emph{quantify} the variable.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1889}{}%
Although there are many types of \emph{quantifiers} in English (e.g., many, few, most, etc.) in mathematics we, for the most part, stick to two: existential and universal.%
\begin{assemblage}[Universal and Existential Quantifiers]\label{assemblage-14}
\hypertarget{p-1890}{}%
\index{quantifiers}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1891}{}%
The existential quantifier is \(\exists\) and is read ``there exists'' or ``there is.'' For example,\index{existential quantifier} \index{quantifiers!exists}\label{notation-13}
%
\begin{equation*}
\exists x (x \lt 0)
\end{equation*}
asserts that there is a number less than 0.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1892}{}%
The universal quantifier is \(\forall\) and is read ``for all'' or ``every.'' For example,\index{universal quantifier} \index{quantifiers!for all} \label{notation-14}
%
\begin{equation*}
\forall x (x \ge 0)
\end{equation*}
asserts that every number is greater than or equal to 0.%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-1893}{}%
As with all mathematical statements, we would like to decide whether quantified statements are true or false. Consider the statement%
\begin{equation*}
\forall x \exists y (y \lt x).
\end{equation*}
You would read this, ``for every \(x\) there is some \(y\) such that \(y\) is less than \(x\).'' Is this true? The answer depends on what our \emph{domain of discourse} is: when we say ``for all'' \(x\), do we mean all positive integers or all real numbers or all elements of some other set? Usually this information is implied. In discrete mathematics, we almost always quantify over the \emph{natural numbers}, 0, 1, 2, \textellipsis{}, so let's take that for our domain of discourse here.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1894}{}%
For the statement to be true, we need it to be the case that no matter what natural number we select, there is always some natural number that is strictly smaller. Perhaps we could let \(y\) be \(x-1\)? But here is the problem: what if \(x = 0\)? Then \(y = -1\) and that is \emph{not a number!} (in our domain of discourse). Thus we see that the statement is false because there is a number which is less than or equal to all other numbers. In symbols,%
\begin{equation*}
\exists x \forall y (y \ge x).
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1895}{}%
To show that the original statement is false, we proved that the \emph{negation} was true. Notice how the negation and original statement compare. This is typical.%
\begin{assemblage}[Quantifiers and Negation]\label{assemblage-15}
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-8}{}
\hypertarget{p-1896}{}%
\(\neg \forall x P(x)\) is equivalent to \(\exists x \neg P(x)\).%

\(\neg \exists x P(x)\) is equivalent to \(\forall x \neg P(x)\).%
\end{quote}
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-1898}{}%
Essentially, we can pass the negation symbol over a quantifier, but that causes the quantifier to switch type. This should not be surprising: if not everything has a property, then something doesn't have that property. And if there is not something with a property, then everything doesn't have that property.%

\section[{Sets}]{Sets}\label{sec_intro-sets}
\hypertarget{p-1969}{}%
The most fundamental objects we will use in our studies (and really in all of math) are \emph{sets}. Much of what follows might be review, but it is very important that you are fluent in the language of set theory. Most of the notation we use below is standard, although some might be a little different than what you have seen before.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1970}{}%
For us, a \terminology{set} \index{set} will simply be an unordered collection of objects. Two examples: we could consider the set of all actors who have played \emph{The Doctor} on \emph{Doctor Who}\index{Doctor Who}, or the set of natural numbers between 1 and 10 inclusive. In the first case, Tom Baker is a element (or member) of the set, while Idris Elba, among many others, is not an element of the set. Also, the two examples are of different sets. Two sets are equal exactly if they contain the exact same elements. For example, the set containing all of the vowels in the declaration of independence is precisely the same set as the set of vowels in the word ``questionably'' (namely, all of them); we do not care about order or repetitions, just whether the element is in the set or not.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection B.2.1 Notation}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{Notation}]{Notation}\label{subsec_notation}
\hypertarget{p-1971}{}%
We need some notation to make talking about sets easier. Consider,%
\begin{equation*}
A = \{1, 2, 3\}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1972}{}%
This is read, ``\(A\) is the set containing the elements 1, 2 and 3.'' We use curly braces ``\(\{,~~ \}\)'' to enclose elements of a set. Some more notation:%
\begin{equation*}
a \in \{a, b, c\}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1973}{}%
The symbol ``\(\in\)'' is read ``is in'' or ``is an element of.'' Thus the above means that \(a\) is an element of the set containing the letters \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). Note that this is a true statement. It would also be true to say that \(d\) is not in that set:%
\begin{equation*}
d \not\in \{a, b, c\}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1974}{}%
Be warned: we write ``\(x \in A\)'' when we wish to express that one of the elements of the set \(A\) is \(x\). For example, consider the set,%
\begin{equation*}
A = \{1, b, \{x, y, z\}, \emptyset\}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1975}{}%
This is a strange set, to be sure. It contains four elements: the number 1, the letter b, the set \(\{x,y,z\}\), and the empty set (\(\emptyset = \{ \}\), the set containing no elements). Is \(x\) in \(A\)? The answer is no. None of the four elements in \(A\) are the letter \(x\), so we must conclude that \(x \notin A\). Similarly, consider the set \(B = \{1,b\}\). Even though the elements of \(B\) are elements of \(A\), we cannot say that the \emph{set} \(B\) is one of the elements of \(A\). Therefore \(B \notin A\). (Soon we will see that \(B\) is a \emph{subset} of \(A\), but this is different from being an \emph{element} of \(A\).)%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1976}{}%
We have described the sets above by listing their elements. Sometimes this is hard to do, especially when there are a lot of elements in the set (perhaps infinitely many). For instance, if we want \(A\) to be the set of all even natural numbers, would could write,%
\begin{equation*}
A = \{0, 2, 4, 6, \ldots\},
\end{equation*}
but this is a little imprecise. A better way would be%
\begin{equation*}
A = \{x \in \N \st \exists n\in \N ( x = 2 n)\}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1977}{}%
Breaking that down: ``\(x \in \N\)'' means \(x\) is in the set \(\N\) (the set of natural numbers, \(\{0,1,2,\ldots\}\)), ``\(:\)'' is read ``such that'' and ``\(\exists n\in \N (x = 2n) \)'' is read ``there exists an \(n\) in the natural numbers for which \(x\) is two times \(n\)'' (in other words, \(x\) is even). Slightly easier might be,%
\begin{equation*}
A = \{x \st x\text{ is even} \}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1978}{}%
Note: Sometimes people use \(|\) or \(\backepsilon\) for the ``such that'' symbol instead of the colon.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-1979}{}%
Defining a set using this sort of notation is very useful, although it takes some practice to read them correctly. It is a way to describe the set of all things that satisfy some condition (the condition is the logical statement after the ``\(\st\)'' symbol). Here are some more examples:%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-19}

\item\hypertarget{li-243}{}\hypertarget{p-1984}{}%

\hypertarget{p-2014}{}%
We have already said what it means for two sets to be equal: they have exactly the same elements. Thus, for example,%
\begin{equation*}
\{1, 2, 3\} = \{2, 1, 3\}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2015}{}%
(Remember, the order the elements are written down in does not matter.) Also,%
\begin{equation*}
\{1, 2, 3\} = \{1, 1+1, 1+1+1\} = \{I, II, III\}
\end{equation*}
since these are all ways to write the set containing the first three positive integers (how we write them doesn't matter, just what they are).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2016}{}%
What about the sets \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\)? Clearly \(A \ne B\), but notice that every element of \(A\) is also an element of \(B\). Because of this we say that \(A\) is a \emph{subset} \index{subset} of \(B\), or in symbols \(A \subset B\) or \(A \subseteq B\). Both symbols are read ``is a subset of.'' The difference is that sometimes we want to say that \(A\) is either equal to or is a subset of \(B\), in which case we use \(\subseteq\). This is analogous to the difference between \(\lt\) and \(\le\).%

Meaningless. A set cannot be less than another set.%
\item\hypertarget{li-288}{}\hypertarget{p-2026}{}%

\item\hypertarget{li-289}{}\hypertarget{p-2027}{}%
Meaningless. \(3\) is not a set, so it cannot be a subset of another set.%
\item\hypertarget{li-290}{}\hypertarget{p-2028}{}%
True. \(3\) is the only element of the set \(\{3\}\), and is an element of \(C\), so every element in \(\{3\}\) is an element of \(C\).%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-2029}{}%
In the example above, \(B\) is a subset of \(A\). You might wonder what other sets are subsets of \(A\). If you collect all these subsets of \(A\) into a new set, we get a set of sets. We call the set of all subsets of \(A\) the \terminology{power set} \index{power set} of \(A\), and write it \(\pow(A)\).%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-21}
\hypertarget{p-2030}{}%
Let \(A = \{1,2,3\}\). Find \(\pow(A)\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-266}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-2031}{}%
\(\pow(A)\) is a set of sets, all of which are subsets of \(A\). So%
\begin{equation*}
\pow(A) = \{ \emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{1,2\}, \{1, 3\}, \{2,3\}, \{1,2,3\}\}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2032}{}%
Notice that while \(2 \in A\), it is wrong to write \(2 \in \pow(A)\) since none of the elements in \(\pow(A)\) are numbers! On the other hand, we do have \(\{2\} \in \pow(A)\) because \(\{2\} \subseteq A\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2033}{}%
What does a subset of \(\pow(A)\) look like? Notice that \(\{2\} \not\subseteq \pow(A)\) because not everything in \(\{2\}\) is in \(\pow(A)\). But we do have \(\{ \{2\} \} \subseteq \pow(A)\). The only element of \(\{\{2\}\}\) is the set \(\{2\}\) which is also an element of \(\pow(A)\). We could take the collection of all subsets of \(\pow(A)\) and call that \(\pow(\pow(A))\). Or even the power set of that set of sets of sets.%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-2034}{}%
Another way to compare sets is by their \emph{size}. Notice that in the example above, \(A\) has 6 elements and \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) all have 3 elements. The size of a set is called the set's \terminology{cardinality} \index{cardinality}. We would write \(|A| = 6\), \(|B| = 3\), and so on. For sets that have a finite number of elements, the cardinality of the set is simply the number of elements in the set. Note that the cardinality of \(\{ 1, 2, 3, 2, 1\}\) is 3. We do not count repeats (in fact, \(\{1, 2, 3, 2, 1\}\) is exactly the same set as \(\{1, 2, 3\}\)). There are sets with infinite cardinality, such as \(\N\), the set of rational numbers (written \(\mathbb Q\)), the set of even natural numbers, and the set of real numbers (\(\mathbb R\)). It is possible to distinguish between different infinite cardinalities, but that is beyond the scope of this text. For us, a set will either be infinite, or finite; if it is finite, the we can determine its cardinality by counting elements.%

\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-294}{}\hypertarget{p-2040}{}%
Since \(38 - 23 = 15\), we can conclude that the cardinality of the set is \(|A| = 16\) (you need to add one since 23 is included).%
\item\hypertarget{li-295}{}\hypertarget{p-2041}{}%
Here \(|B| = 3\). The three elements are the number 1, the set \(\{2,3,4\}\), and the empty set.%
\item\hypertarget{li-296}{}\hypertarget{p-2042}{}%
We wrote out the elements of the power set \(\pow(C)\) above, and there are 8 elements (each of which is a set). So \(\card{\pow(C)} = 8\).  (You might wonder if there is a relationship between \(\card{A}\) and \(\card{\pow(A)}\) for all sets \(A\).  This is a good question which we will consider in \hyperref[ch_basic-combinatorics]{Chapter~\ref{ch_basic-combinatorics}}.)%

\subsection[{Operations On Sets}]{Operations On Sets}\label{subsection-49}
\hypertarget{p-2043}{}%
Is it possible to add two sets? Not really, however there is something similar. If we want to combine two sets to get the collection of objects that are in either set, then we can take the \terminology{union} \index{union} of the two sets. Symbolically,%
\begin{equation*}
C = A \cup B,
\end{equation*}
read, ``\(C\) is the union of \(A\) and \(B\),'' means that the elements of \(C\) are exactly the elements which are either an element of \(A\) or an element of \(B\) (or an element of both). For example, if \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(B = \{2, 3, 4\}\), then \(A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2044}{}%
The other common operation on sets is \terminology{intersection} \index{intersection}. We write,%
\begin{equation*}
C = A \cap B
\end{equation*}
and say, ``\(C\) is the intersection of \(A\) and \(B\),'' when the elements in \(C\) are precisely those both in \(A\) and in \(B\). So if \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and \(B = \{2, 3, 4\}\), then \(A \cap B = \{2, 3\}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2045}{}%
Often when dealing with sets, we will have some understanding as to what ``everything'' is. Perhaps we are only concerned with natural numbers. In this case we would say that our \terminology{universe} is \(\N\). Sometimes we denote this universe by \(\U\). Given this context, we might wish to speak of all the elements which are \emph{not} in a particular set. We say \(B\) is the \terminology{complement} \index{complement} of \(A\), and write,%
\begin{equation*}
B = \overline A
\end{equation*}
when \(B\) contains every element not contained in \(A\). So, if our universe is \(\{1, 2,\ldots, 9, 10\}\), and \(A = \{2, 3, 5, 7\}\), then \(\overline A = \{1, 4, 6, 8, 9,10\}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2046}{}%
Of course we can perform more than one operation at a time. For example, consider%
\begin{equation*}
A \cap \overline B.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2047}{}%
This is the set of all elements which are both elements of \(A\) and not elements of \(B\). What have we done? We've started with \(A\) and removed all of the elements which were in \(B\). Another way to write this is the \terminology{set difference} \index{set difference} \index{difference, of sets}:%
\begin{equation*}
A \cap \overline B = A \setminus B.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2048}{}%
It is important to remember that these operations (union, intersection, complement, and difference) on sets produce other sets. Don't confuse these with the symbols from the previous section (element of and subset of). \(A \cap B\) is a set, while \(A \subseteq B\) is true or false. This is the same difference as between \(3 + 2\) (which is a number) and \(3 \le 2\) (which is false).%

\hypertarget{p-2051}{}%
You might notice that the symbols for union and intersection slightly resemble the logic symbols for ``or'' and ``and.'' This is no accident. What does it mean for \(x\) to be an element of \(A\cup B\)? It means that \(x\) is an element of \(A\) \emph{or} \(x\) is an element of \(B\) (or both). That is,%
\begin{equation*}
x \in A \cup B \qquad \Iff \qquad x \in A \vee x \in B.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2052}{}%
Similarly,%
\begin{equation*}
x \in A \cap B \qquad \Iff \qquad x \in A \wedge x \in B.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2053}{}%
Also,%
\begin{equation*}
x \in \overline A \qquad \Iff \qquad \neg (x \in A).
\end{equation*}
which says \(x\) is an element of the complement of \(A\) if \(x\) is not an element of \(A\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2054}{}%
There is one more way to combine sets which will be useful for us: the \terminology{Cartesian product}\index{Cartesian product}, \(A \times B\)\label{notation-33}
. This sounds fancy but is nothing you haven't seen before. When you graph a function in calculus, you graph it in the Cartesian plane. This is the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers \((x,y)\). We can do this for \emph{any} pair of sets, not just the real numbers with themselves.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2055}{}%
Put another way, \(A \times B = \{(a,b) \st a \in A \wedge b \in B\}\). The first coordinate comes from the first set and the second coordinate comes from the second set. Sometimes we will want to take the Cartesian product of a set with itself, and this is fine: \(A \times A = \{(a,b) \st a, b \in A\}\) (we might also write \(A^2\) for this set). Notice that in \(A \times A\), we still want \emph{all} ordered pairs, not just the ones where the first and second coordinate are the same. We can also take products of 3 or more sets, getting ordered triples, or quadruples, and so on.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-24}
\hypertarget{p-2056}{}%
Let \(A = \{1,2\}\) and \(B = \{3,4,5\}\). Find \(A \times B\) and \(A \times A\). How many elements do you expect to be in \(B \times B\)?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-269}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-2057}{}%
\(A \times B = \{(1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,4), (2,5)\}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2058}{}%
\(A \times A = A^2 = \{(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)\}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2059}{}%
\(|B\times B| = 9\). There will be 3 pairs with first coordinate \(3\), three more with first coordinate \(4\), and a final three with first coordinate \(5\).%

\index{Venn diagram} There is a very nice visual tool we can use to represent operations on sets. A \terminology{Venn diagram} displays sets as intersecting circles. We can shade the region we are talking about when we carry out an operation. We can also represent cardinality of a particular set by putting the number in the corresponding region.%

Each circle represents a set. The rectangle containing the circles represents the universe. To represent combinations of these sets, we shade the corresponding region. For example, we could draw \(A \cap B\) as:%

Notice that the shaded regions above could also be arrived at in another way. We could have started with all of \(C\), then excluded the region where \(C\) and \(A\) overlap outside of \(B\). That region is \((A \cap C) \cap \overline B\). So the above Venn diagram also represents \(C \cap \overline{\left((A\cap C)\cap \overline B\right)}.\) So using just the picture, we have determined that%

\section[{Functions}]{Functions}\label{sec_background-functions}
\(\textit{}\)\hypertarget{p-2119}{}%
A \terminology{function}\index{function} is a rule that assigns each input exactly one output.  We call the output the \terminology{image} of the input.  The set of all inputs for a function is called the \terminology{domain}\index{domain}. The set of all allowable outputs is called the \terminology{codomain}\index{codomain}. We would write \(f:X \to Y\) to describe a function with name \(f\), domain \(X\) and codomain \(Y\). This does not tell us \emph{which} function \(f\) is though. To define the function, we must describe the rule. This is often done by giving a formula to compute the output for any input (although this is certainly not the only way to describe the rule).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2120}{}%
For example, consider the function \(f:\N \to \N\) defined by \(f(x) = x^2 + 3\). Here the domain and codomain are the same set (the natural numbers). The rule is: take your input, multiply it by itself and add 3. This works because we can apply this rule to every natural number (every element of the domain) and the result is always a natural number (an element of the codomain). Notice though that not every natural number is actually an output (there is no way to get 0, 1, 2, 5, etc.). The set of natural numbers that \emph{are} outputs is called the \terminology{range}\index{range} of the function (in this case, the range is \(\{3, 4, 7, 12, 19, 28, \ldots\}\), all the natural numbers that are 3 more than a perfect square).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2121}{}%
The key thing that makes a rule a \emph{function} is that there is \emph{exactly one} output for each input. That is, it is important that the rule be a good rule. What output do we assign to the input 7? There can only be one answer for any particular function.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-25}
\hypertarget{p-2122}{}%
The following are all examples of functions: \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-359}{}\hypertarget{p-2123}{}%
\(f:\Z \to \Z\) defined by \(f(n) = 3n\). The domain and codomain are both the set of integers. However, the range is only the set of integer multiples of 3.%
\item\hypertarget{li-360}{}\hypertarget{p-2124}{}%
\(g: \{1,2,3\} \to \{a,b,c\}\) defined by \(g(1) = c\), \(g(2) = a\) and \(g(3) = a\). The domain is the set \(\{1,2,3\}\), the codomain is the set \(\{a,b,c\}\) and the range is the set \(\{a,c\}\). Note that \(g(2)\) and \(g(3)\) are the same element of the codomain. This is okay since each element in the domain still has only one output.%
\item\hypertarget{li-361}{}\hypertarget{p-2125}{}%

\par
\hypertarget{p-2126}{}%
Here the domain is the finite set \(\{1,2,3,4\}\) and to codomain is the set of natural numbers, \(\N\).  At first you might think this function is the same as \(f\) defined above.  It is absolutely not.  Even though the rule is the same, the domain and codomain are different, so these are two different functions.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[]\label{example-26}
\hypertarget{p-2127}{}%
Just because you can describe a rule in the same way you would write a function, does not mean that the rule is a function.  The following are NOT functions. \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-362}{}\hypertarget{p-2128}{}%
\(f:\N \to \N\) defined by \(f(n) = \frac{n}{2}\).  The reason this is not a function is because not every input has an output.  Where does \(f\) send 3?  The rule says that \(f(3) = \frac{3}{2}\), but \(\frac{3}{2}\) is not an element of the codomain.%
\item\hypertarget{li-363}{}\hypertarget{p-2129}{}%
Consider the rule that matches each person to their phone number.  If you think of the set of people as the domain and the set of phone numbers as the codomain, then this is not a function, since some people have two phone numbers.  Switching the domain and codomain sets doesn't help either, since some phone numbers belong to multiple people (assuming some households still have landlines when you are reading this).%

\subsection[{Describing Functions}]{Describing Functions}\label{subsection-51}
\hypertarget{p-2130}{}%
It is worth making a distinction between a function and its description.  The function is the abstract mathematical object that in some way exists whether or not anyone ever talks about it.  But when we \emph{do} want to talk about the function, we need a way to describe it.  A particular function can be described in multiple ways.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2131}{}%
Some calculus textbooks talk about the \emph{Rule of Four}: that every function can be described in four ways: algebraically (a formula), numerically (a table), graphically, or in words.  In discrete math, we can still use any of these to describe functions, but we can also be more specific since we are primarily concerned with functions that have \(\N\) or a finite subset of \(\N\) as their domain.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2132}{}%
Describing a function graphically usually means drawing the graph of the function: plotting the points on the plain. We can do this, and might get a graph like the following for a function \(f:\{1,2,3\} \to \{1,2,3\}\).%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0.35}{0.35}{0}
\begin{sbspanel}{0.3}
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{{

\end{sbspanel}
\end{sidebyside}
\par
\hypertarget{p-2133}{}%
It would be absolutely WRONG to connect the dots or try to fit them to some curve. There are only three elements in the domain. A curve would mean that the domain contains an entire interval of real numbers.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2134}{}%
Here is another way to represent that same function:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0.415}{0.415}{0}
\begin{sbspanel}{0.17}
\resizebox{\linewidth}{!}{{
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.85]

  \draw[->] (0,1) node[above] {2} -- (-1,0) node[below] {1};
  \draw[->] (1,1) node[above] {3} -- (1,0) node[below] {3};
\end{tikzpicture}
}
}
\end{sbspanel}
\end{sidebyside}
\par
\hypertarget{p-2135}{}%
This shows that the function \(f\) sends 1 to 2, 2 to 1 and 3 to 3: just follow the arrows.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2136}{}%
The arrow diagram used to define the function above can be very helpful in visualizing functions. We will often be working with functions with \emph{finite} domains, so this kind of picture is often more useful than a traditional graph of a function.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2137}{}%
Note that for finite domains, finding an algebraic formula that gives the output for any input is often impossible.  Of course we could use a piecewise defined function, like%
\begin{equation*}
f(x) = \begin{cases} x+1 \amp \text{ if } x = 1 \\ x-1 \amp \text{ if } x = 2 \\ x \amp \text{ if } x = 3\end{cases}.
\end{equation*}
This describes exactly the same function as above, but we can all agree is a ridiculous way of doing so.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2138}{}%
Since we will so often use functions with small domains and codomains, let's adopt some notation to describe them.  All we need is some clear way of denoting the image of each element in the domain. In fact, writing a table of values would work perfectly:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0}{0}{0}
\begin{sbspanel}{1}
{\centering%
\begin{tabular}{llllll}
\multicolumn{1}{cA}{\(x\)}&0&1&2&3&4\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\multicolumn{1}{cA}{\(f(x)\)}&3&3&2&4&1
\end{tabular}
\par}
\end{sbspanel}
\end{sidebyside}
\par
\hypertarget{p-2139}{}%
We simplify this further by writing this as a matrix with each input directly over its output:%
\begin{equation*}
f = \twoline{0 \amp 1 \amp 2\amp 3 \amp 4}{3 \amp 3 \amp 2 \amp 4 \amp 1}
\end{equation*}
Note this is just notation and not the same sort of matrix you would find in a linear algebra class (it does not make sense to do operations with these matrices, or row reduce them, for example).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2140}{}%
One advantage of the two-line notation over the arrow diagrams is that it is harder to accidentally define a rule that is not a function using two-line notation.%

\(f\) is a function. So is \(g\). There is no problem with an element of the codomain not being the image of any input, and there is no problem with \(a\) from the codomain being the image of both 2 and 3 from the domain. We could use our two-line notation to write these as%
\begin{equation*}
f= \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \\ d \amp a \amp c \amp b \end{pmatrix} \qquad g = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \\ d \amp a \amp a \amp b \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2143}{}%
However, \(h\) is NOT a function. In fact, it fails for two reasons. First, the element 1 from the domain has not been mapped to any element from the codomain. Second, the element 2 from the domain has been mapped to more than one element from the codomain (\(a\) and \(c\)). Note that either one of these problems is enough to make a rule not a function. In general, neither of the following mappings are functions:%

\par
\hypertarget{p-2144}{}%
It might also be helpful to think about how you would write the two-line notation for \(h\). We would have something like:%
\begin{equation*}
h=\twoline{1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4}{\amp a,c? \amp d \amp b}.
\end{equation*}
There is nothing under 1 (bad) and we needed to put more than one thing under 2 (very bad). With a rule that is actually a function, the two-line notation will always ``work''.%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-2145}{}%
We will also be interested in functions with domain \(\N\).  Here two-line notation is no good, but describing the function algebraically is often possible.  Even tables are a little awkward, since they do not describe the function completely.  For example, consider the function \(f:\N \to \N\) given by the table below.%

Have I given you enough entries for you to be able to determine \(f(6)\)?  You might guess that \(f(6) = 36\), but there is no way for you to \emph{know} this for sure.  Maybe I am being a jerk and intended \(f(6) = 42\).  In fact, for every natural number \(n\), there is a function that agrees with the table above, but for which \(f(6) = n\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2147}{}%
Okay, suppose I really did mean for \(f(6) = 36\), and in fact, for the rule that you think is governing the function to actually be the rule.  Then I should say what that rule is.  \(f(n) = n^2\).  Now there is no confusion possible.%

\index{closed formula!for a function} Giving an explicit formula that calculates the image of any element in the domain is a great way to describe a function.  We will say that these explicit rules are \terminology{closed formulas} for the function.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2149}{}%
There is another very useful way to describe functions whose domain is \(\N\), that rely specifically on the structure of the natural numbers.  We can define a function \emph{recursively}!%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-28}
\hypertarget{p-2150}{}%
Consider the function \(f:\N \to \N\) given by \(f(0) = 0\) and \(f(n+1) = f(n) + 2n+1\).  Find \(f(6)\).%

\hypertarget{p-2151}{}%
The rule says that \(f(6) = f(5) + 11\) (we are using \(6 = n+1\) so \(n = 5\)).  We don't know what \(f(5)\) is though.  Well, we know that \(f(5) = f(4) + 9\).  So we need to compute \(f(4)\), which will require knowing \(f(3)\), which will require \(f(2)\),\textellipsis{} will it ever end?%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2152}{}%
Yes!  In fact, this process will always end because we have \(\N\) as our domain, so there is a least element.  And we gave the value of \(f(0)\) explicitly, so we are good.  In fact, we might decide to work up to \(f(6)\) instead of working down from \(f(6)\):%
\begin{align*}
f(1) = \amp f(0) + 1 = \amp 0 + 1 = 1\\
f(2) = \amp f(1) + 3 = \amp 1 + 3 = 4\\
f(3) = \amp f(2) + 5 = \amp 4 + 5 = 9\\
f(4) = \amp f(3) + 7 = \amp 9 + 7 = 16\\
f(5) = \amp f(4) + 9 = \amp 16 + 9 = 25\\

It looks that this recursively defined function is the same as the explicitly defined function \(f(n) = n^2\).  Is it?  Later we will prove that it is.%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-2154}{}%
Recursively defined functions are often easier to create from a ``real world'' problem, because they describe how the values of the functions are changing.  However, this comes with a price. It is harder to calculate the image of a single input, since you need to know the images of other (previous) elements in the domain.%
\begin{assemblage}[Recursively Defined Functions]\label{assemblage-18}
\hypertarget{p-2155}{}%
For a function \(f:\N \to \N\), a \terminology{recursive definition} consists of an \terminology{initial condition} together with a \terminology{recurrence relation}.  The initial condition is the explicitly given value of \(f(0)\). The recurrence relation is a formula for \(f(n+1)\) in terms for \(f(n)\) (and possibly \(n\) itself).%

\begin{enumerate}

The initial condition is \(f(0) = 3\).  To get \(f(n+1)\) we would double the number of snails in the terrarium the previous year, which is given by \(f(n)\).  Thus \(f(n+1) = 2f(n)\).  The full recursive definition contains both of these, and would be written,%
\begin{equation*}
f(0) = 3;~ f(n+1) = 2f(n).

\item\hypertarget{li-368}{}\hypertarget{p-2162}{}%
We are told that on day 0 you can do 7 push-ups, so \(f(0) = 7\).  The number of push-ups you can do on day \(n+1\) is 2 more than the number you can do on day \(n\), which is given by \(f(n)\).  Thus%
\begin{equation*}
f(0) = 7;~ f(n+1) = f(n) + 2.
\end{equation*}
%
\item\hypertarget{li-369}{}\hypertarget{p-2163}{}%
Here \(f(0) = 1\).  To get the recurrence relation, think about how you can get \(f(n+1) = (n+1)!\) from \(f(n) = n!\).  If you write out both of these as products, you see that \((n+1)!\) is just like \(n!\) except you have one more term in the product, an extra \(n+1\).  So we have,%

f(0) = 1;~ f(n+1) = (n+1)\cdot f(n).

In the examples above, you may have noticed that sometimes there are elements of the codomain which are not in the range. When this sort of the thing \emph{does not} happen, (that is, when everything in the codomain is in the range) we say the function is \terminology{onto}\index{onto} or that the function maps the domain \emph{onto} the codomain. This terminology should make sense: the function puts the domain (entirely) on top of the codomain. The fancy math term for an onto function is a \terminology{surjection}\index{surjection}, and we say that an onto function is a \terminology{surjective} function.%

\item\hypertarget{li-373}{}\(f\) is not surjective. There are elements in the codomain which are not in the range. For example, no \(n \in \Z\) gets mapped to the number 1 (the rule would say that \(\frac{1}{3}\) would be sent to 1, but \(\frac{1}{3}\) is not in the domain). In fact, the range of the function is \(3\Z\) (the integer multiples of 3), which is not equal to \(\Z\).%
\item\hypertarget{li-374}{}\(g\) is not surjective. There is no \(x \in \{1,2,3\}\) (the domain) for which \(g(x) = b\), so \(b\), which is in the codomain, is not in the range. Notice that there is an element from the codomain ``missing'' from the bottom row of the matrix.%

To be a function, a rule cannot assign a single element of the domain to two or more different elements of the codomain. However, we have seen that the reverse \emph{is} permissible: a function might assign the same element of the codomain to two or more different elements of the domain. When this \emph{does not} occur (that is, when each element of the codomain is the image of at most one element of the domain) then we say the function is \terminology{one-to-one}\index{one-to-one}. Again, this terminology makes sense: we are sending at most one element from the domain to one element from the codomain. One input to one output. The fancy math term for a one-to-one function is an \terminology{injection}\index{injection}. We call one-to-one functions \terminology{injective} functions.%

Be careful: ``surjective'' and ``injective'' are NOT opposites.  You can see in the two examples above that there are functions which are surjective but not injective, injective but not surjective, both, or neither. In the case when a function is both one-to-one and onto (an injection and surjection), we say the function is a \terminology{bijection}\index{bijection}, or that the function is a \terminology{bijective} function.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2178}{}%
To illustrate the contrast between these two properties, consider a more formal definition of each, side by side.%
\begin{assemblage}[Injective vs Surjective]\label{assemblage-19}

A function is \terminology{injective} provided every element of the codomain is the image of \emph{at most} one element from the domain.%

Notice both properties are determined by what happens to elements of the codomain: they could be repeated as images or they could be ``missed'' (not be images).  Injective functions do not have repeats but might or might not miss elements.  Surjective functions do not miss elements, but might or might not have repeats.  The bijective functions are those that do not have repeats and do not miss elements.%

\hypertarget{p-2182}{}%
When discussing functions, we have notation for talking about an element of the domain (say \(x\)) and its corresponding element in the codomain (we write \(f(x)\), which \emph{is} the image of \(x\)). Sometimes we will want to talk about all the elements that are images of some subset of the domain.  It would also be nice to start with some element of the codomain (say \(y\)) and talk about which element or elements (if any) from the domain it is the image of. We could write ``those \(x\) in the domain such that \(f(x) = y\),'' but this is a lot of writing. Here is some notation to make our lives easier.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2183}{}%
To address the first situation, what we are after is a way to describe the \emph{set} of images of elements in some subset of the domain.  Suppose \(f:X \to Y\) is a function and that \(A \subseteq X\) is some subset of the domain (possibly all of it).  We will use the notation \(f(A)\) to denote the \terminology{image of \(A\) under \(f\)}, namely the set of elements in \(Y\) that are the image of elements from \(A\).  That is, \(f(A) = \{f(a) \in Y \st a \in A\}\). \label{notation-34}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2184}{}%
We can do this in the other direction as well.  We might ask which elements of the domain get mapped to a particular set in the codomain.  Let \(f:X \to Y\) be a function and suppose \(B \subseteq Y\) is a subset of the codomain.  Then we will write \(f\inv(B)\) for the \terminology{inverse image of \(B\) under \(f\)}, namely the set of elements in \(X\) whose image are elements in \(B\).  In other words, \(f\inv(B) = \{x \in X \st f(x) \in B\}\). \label{notation-35}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2185}{}%
Often we are interested in the element(s) whose image is a particular element \(y\) of in the codomain.  The notation above works: \(f\inv(\{y\})\) is the set of all elements in the domain that \(f\) sends to \(y\).  It makes sense to think of this as a set: there might not be anything sent to \(y\) (if \(y\) is not in the range), in which case \(f\inv(\{y\}) = \emptyset\).  Or \(f\) might send multiple elements to \(y\) (if \(f\) is not injective).  As a notational convenience, we usually drop the set braces around the \(y\) and write \(f\inf(y)\) instead for this set.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2186}{}%
WARNING: \(f\inv(y)\) is not an inverse function! Inverse functions only exist for bijections, but \(f\inv(y)\) is defined for any function \(f\). The point: \(f\inv(y)\) is a \emph{set}, not an \emph{element} of the domain.  This is just sloppy notation for \(f\inv(\{y\})\).  To help make this distinction, we would call \(f\inv(y)\) the \terminology{complete inverse image of \(y\) under \(f\)}.  It is not the image of \(y\) under \(f\inv\) (since the function \(f\inv\) might not exist).%

\(f(\{1,2,3\}) = \{a,b\}\) since \(a\) and \(b\) are the elements in the codomain to which \(f\) sends \(1\) and \(2\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2189}{}%
\(f\inf(\{a,b\}) = \{1,2,3,4,5\}\) since these are exactly the elements that \(f\) sends to \(a\) and \(b\).%

\(f\inf(d) = \emptyset\) since \(d\) is not in the range of \(f\).%

Consider the function \(g:\Z \to \Z\) defined by \(g(n) = n^2 + 1\). Find \(g(1)\) and \(g(\{1\})\).  Then find \(g\inv(1)\), \(g\inv(2)\), and \(g\inv(3)\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-282}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-2192}{}%
Note that \(g(1) \ne g(\{1\})\).  The first is an element: \(g(1) = 2\).  The second is a set: \(g(\{1\}) = \{2\}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2193}{}%
To find \(g\inv(1)\), we need to find all integers \(n\) such that \(n^2 + 1 = 1\). Clearly only 0 works, so \(g\inv(1) = \{0\}\) (note that even though there is only one element, we still write it as a set with one element in it).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2194}{}%
To find \(g\inv(2)\), we need to find all \(n\) such that \(n^2 + 1 = 2\). We see \(g\inv(2) = \{-1,1\}\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2195}{}%
Finally, if \(n^2 + 1 = 3\), then we are looking for an \(n\) such that \(n^2 = 2\). There are no such integers so \(g\inv(3) = \emptyset\).%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-2196}{}%
Since \(f\inv(y)\) is a set, it makes sense to ask for \(\card{f\inv(y)}\), the number of elements in the domain which map to \(y\).%

\hypertarget{p-2198}{}%
There is only one such function. We need five elements of the domain to map to the number \(7 \in \N\). Since there are only five elements in the domain, all of them must map to 7. So%
\begin{equation*}
f = \begin{pmatrix}1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5 \\ 7 \amp 7 \amp 7 \amp 7 \amp 7\end{pmatrix}.

A \terminology{proposition}\index{proposition} is simply a statement. \terminology{Propositional logic} studies the ways statements can interact with each other. It is important to remember that propositional logic does not really care about the content of the statements. For example, in terms of propositional logic, the claims, ``if the moon is made of cheese then basketballs are round,'' and ``if spiders have eight legs then Sam walks with a limp'' are exactly the same. They are both implications: statements of the form, \(P \imp Q\).%

Here's a question about playing Monopoly:%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-10}{}
\hypertarget{p-2322}{}%
If you get more doubles than any other player then you will lose, or if you lose then you must have bought the most properties.%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-2323}{}%
True or false? We will answer this question, and won't need to know anything about Monopoly. Instead we will look at the logical \emph{form} of the statement.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2324}{}%
We need to decide when the statement \((P \imp Q) \vee (Q \imp R)\) is true. Using the definitions of the connectives in \hyperref[sec_background-statements]{Section~\ref{sec_background-statements}}, we see that for this to be true, either \(P \imp Q\) must be true or \(Q \imp R\) must be true (or both). Those are true if either \(P\) is false or \(Q\) is true (in the first case) and \(Q\) is false or \(R\) is true (in the second case). So\textemdash{}yeah, it gets kind of messy. Luckily, we can make a chart to keep track of all the possibilities. Enter \terminology{truth tables}. The idea is this: on each row, we list a possible combination of T's and F's (for true and false) for each of the sentential variables, and then mark down whether the statement in question is true or false in that case. We do this for every possible combination of T's and F's. Then we can clearly see in which cases the statement is true or false. For complicated statements, we will first fill in values for each part of the statement, as a way of breaking up our task into smaller, more manageable pieces.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2325}{}%
Since the truth value of a statement is completely determined by the truth values of its parts and how they are connected, all you really need to know is the truth tables for each of the logical connectives. Here they are:%
\begin{sidebyside}{4}{0.025}{0.025}{0.05}

\hypertarget{p-2327}{}%
None of these truth tables should come as a surprise; they are all just restating the definitions of the connectives. Let's try another one.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-35}
\hypertarget{p-2328}{}%
Make a truth table for the statement \(\neg P \vee Q\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-301}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-2329}{}%
Note that this statement is not \(\neg(P \vee Q)\), the negation belongs to \(P\) alone. Here is the truth table:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0}{0}{0}
\begin{sbspanel}{1}
{\centering%
\begin{tabular}{cAcBcAc}
\(P\)&\(Q\)&\(\neg P\)&\(\neg P \vee Q\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin

\end{tabular}
\par}
\end{sbspanel}
\end{sidebyside}
\par
\hypertarget{p-2330}{}%
We added a column for \(\neg P\) to make filling out the last column easier. The entries in the \(\neg P\) column were determined by the entries in the \(P\) column. Then to fill in the final column, look only at the column for \(Q\) and the column for \(\neg P\) and use the rule for \(\vee\).%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-2331}{}%
Now let's answer our question about monopoly:%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-36}
\hypertarget{p-2332}{}%
Analyze the statement, ``if you get more doubles than any other player you will lose, or that if you lose you must have bought the most properties,'' using truth tables.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-302}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-2333}{}%
Represent the statement in symbols as \((P \imp Q) \vee (Q \imp R)\), where \(P\) is the statement ``you get more doubles than any other player,'' \(Q\) is the statement ``you will lose,'' and \(R\) is the statement ``you must have bought the most properties.'' Now make a truth table.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2334}{}%
The truth table needs to contain 8 rows in order to account for every possible combination of truth and falsity among the three statements. Here is the full truth table:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0}{0}{0}
\begin{sbspanel}{1}
{\centering%
\begin{tabular}{cAcAcBcAcAc}
\(P\)&\(Q\)&\(R\)&\(P \imp Q\)&\(Q \imp R\)&\((P \imp Q) \vee (Q \imp R)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin

F&F&F&T&T&T
\end{tabular}
\par}
\end{sbspanel}
\end{sidebyside}
\par
\hypertarget{p-2335}{}%
The first three columns are simply a systematic listing of all possible combinations of T and F for the three statements (do you see how you would list the 16 possible combinations for four statements?). The next two columns are determined by the values of \(P\), \(Q\), and \(R\) and the definition of implication. Then, the last column is determined by the values in the previous two columns and the definition of \(\vee\). It is this final column we care about.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2336}{}%
Notice that in each of the eight possible cases, the statement in question is true. So our statement about monopoly is true (regardless of how many properties you own, how many doubles you roll, or whether you win or lose).%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-2337}{}%
The statement about monopoly is an example of a \terminology{tautology}\index{tautology}, a statement which is true on the basis of its logical form alone. Tautologies are always true but they don't tell us much about the world. No knowledge about monopoly was required to determine that the statement was true. In fact, it is equally true that ``If the moon is made of cheese, then Elvis is still alive, or if Elvis is still alive, then unicorns have 5 legs.''%

You might have noticed that the final column in the truth table from \(\neg P \vee Q\) is identical to the final column in the truth table for \(P \imp Q\):%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0}{0}{0}
\begin{sbspanel}{1}

\begin{tabular}{cAcBcAc}
\(P\)&\(Q\)&\(P \imp Q\)&\(\neg P \vee Q\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin

\end{sbspanel}
\end{sidebyside}
\par
\hypertarget{p-2339}{}%
This says that no matter what \(P\) and \(Q\) are, the statements \(\neg P \vee Q\) and \(P \imp Q\) either both true or both false. We therefore say these statements are \terminology{logically equivalent}.%
\begin{assemblage}[Logical Equivalence]\label{assemblage-21}
\hypertarget{p-2340}{}%
Two (molecular) statements \(P\) and \(Q\) are \terminology{logically equivalent} \index{logical equivalence} provided \(P\) is true precisely when \(Q\) is true.  That is, \(P\) and \(Q\) have the same truth value under any assignment of truth values to their atomic parts.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2341}{}%
To verify that two statements are logically equivalent, you can make a truth table for each and check whether the columns for the two statements are identical.%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-2342}{}%
Recognizing two statements as logically equivalent can be very helpful. Rephrasing a mathematical statement can often lends insight into what it is saying, or how to prove or refute it. Using truth tables we can systematically verify that two statements are indeed logically equivalent.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-37}
\hypertarget{p-2343}{}%
Are the statements, ``it will not rain or snow'' and ``it will not rain and it will not snow'' logically equivalent?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-303}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-2344}{}%
We want to know whether \(\neg(P \vee Q)\) is logically equivalent to \(\neg P \wedge \neg Q\). Make a truth table which includes both statements:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0}{0}{0}
\begin{sbspanel}{1}
{\centering%
\begin{tabular}{cAcBcAc}
\(P\)&\(Q\)&\(\neg(P \vee Q)\)&\(\neg P \wedge \neg Q\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
T&T&F&F\tabularnewline[0pt]
T&F&F&F\tabularnewline[0pt]

F&F&T&T
\end{tabular}
\par}
\end{sbspanel}
\end{sidebyside}
\par
\hypertarget{p-2345}{}%
Since in every row the truth values for the two statements are equal, the two statements are logically equivalent.%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-2346}{}%
Notice that this example gives us a way to ``distribute'' a negation over a disjunction (an ``or''). We have a similar rule for distributing over conjunctions (``and''s):%
\begin{assemblage}[De Morgan's Laws]\label{assemblage-22}
\hypertarget{p-2347}{}%
\index{De Morgan's laws}%
\begin{equation*}
\neg(P \wedge Q) \text{ is logically equivalent to } \neg P \vee \neg Q.
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
\neg(P \vee Q) \text{ is logically equivalent to } \neg P \wedge \neg Q.
\end{equation*}
%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-2348}{}%
This suggests there might be a sort of ``algebra'' you could apply to statements (okay, there is: it is called \emph{Boolean algebra}) to transform one statement into another. We can start collecting useful examples of logical equivalence, and apply them in succession to a statement, instead of writing out a complicated truth table. We will probably also want a way to deal with double negation:%
\begin{assemblage}[Double Negation]\label{assemblage-23}
\hypertarget{p-2349}{}%
\index{double negation}%
\begin{equation*}
\neg \neg P \mbox{ is logically equivalent to } P.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2350}{}%
Example: ``It is not the case that \(c\) is not odd'' means ``\(c\) is odd.''%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-2351}{}%
Let's see how we can apply the equivalences we have encountered so far.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-38}
\hypertarget{p-2352}{}%
Prove that the statements \(\neg(P \imp Q)\) and \(P\wedge \neg Q\) are logically equivalent without using truth tables.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-304}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-2353}{}%
We want to start with one of the statements, and transform it into the other through a sequence of logically equivalent statements. Start with \(\neg(P \imp Q)\). We can rewrite the implication as a disjunction this is logically equivalent to%
\begin{equation*}
\neg(\neg P \vee Q).
\end{equation*}
Now apply DeMorgan's law to get%
\begin{equation*}
\neg\neg P \wedge \neg Q.
\end{equation*}
Finally, use double negation to arrive at \(P \wedge \neg Q\)%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-2354}{}%
Notice that the above example illustrates that the negation of an implication is NOT an implication: it is a conjunction!%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2355}{}%
To verify that two statements are logically equivalent, you can use truth tables or a sequence of logically equivalent replacements. The truth table method, although cumbersome, has the advantage that it can verify that two statements are NOT logically equivalent.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-39}
\hypertarget{p-2356}{}%
Are the statements \((P \vee Q) \imp R\) and \((P \imp R) \vee (Q \imp R)\) logically equivalent?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-305}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-2357}{}%
Note that while we could start rewriting these statements with logically equivalent replacements in the hopes of transforming one into another, we will never be sure that our failure is due to their lack of logical equivalence rather than our lack of imagination. So instead, let's make a truth table:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0}{0}{0}
\begin{sbspanel}{1}
{\centering%
\begin{tabular}{cAcAcBcAc}
\(P\)&\(Q\)&\(R\)&\((P\vee Q) \imp R\)&\((P\imp R) \vee (Q \imp R)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
T&T&T&T&T\tabularnewline[0pt]
T&T&F&F&F\tabularnewline[0pt]
T&F&T&T&T\tabularnewline[0pt]
T&F&F&F&T\tabularnewline[0pt]

\end{tabular}
\par}
\end{sbspanel}
\end{sidebyside}
\par
\hypertarget{p-2358}{}%
Look at the fourth (or sixth) row. In this case, \((P \imp R) \vee (Q \imp R)\) is true, but \((P \vee Q) \imp R\) is false. Therefore the statements are not logically equivalent.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2359}{}%
While we don't have logical equivalence, it is the case that whenever \((P \vee Q) \imp R\) is true, so is \((P \imp R) \vee (Q \imp R)\).  This tells us that we can \emph{deduce} \((P \imp R) \vee (Q \imp R)\) from \((P \vee Q) \imp R\), just not the reverse direction.%

This is just the truth table for \(P \imp Q\), but what matters here is that all the lines in the deduction rule have their own column in the truth table.

Which \emph{rows} of the truth table correspond to both of these being true? \(P\) is true in the first two rows, and of those, only the first row has \(P \imp Q\) true as well. And lo-and-behold, in this one case, \(Q\) is also true. So if \(P\imp Q\) and \(P\) are both true, we see that \(Q\) must be true as well.%

\hypertarget{p-2377}{}%
As we saw in \hyperref[sec_background-statements]{Section~\ref{sec_background-statements}}, not every statement can be analyzed using logical connectives alone.  For example, we might want to work with the statement:%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-12}{}
\hypertarget{p-2378}{}%
All primes greater than 2 are odd.%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-2379}{}%
To write this statement symbolically, we must use quantifiers.  We can translate as follows:%
\begin{equation*}
\forall x ((P(x) \wedge x \gt 2) \imp O(x)).
\end{equation*}
In this case, we are using \(P(x)\) to denote ``\(x\) is prime'' and \(O(x)\) to denote ``\(x\) is odd.''  These are not propositions, since their truth value depends on the input \(x\).  Better to think of \(P\) and \(O\) as denoting \emph{properties} of their input.  The technical term is \terminology{predicates} and when we study them in logic, we need to use \terminology{predicate logic}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2380}{}%
It is important to stress that predicate logic \emph{extends} propositional logic (much in the way quantum mechanics extends classical mechanics).  You will notice that our statement above still used the (propositional) logical connectives.  Everything that we learned about logical equivalence and deductions still applies.  However, predicate logic allows us to analyze statements at a higher resolution, digging down into the individual propositions \(P\), \(Q\), etc.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2381}{}%
A full treatment of predicate logic is beyond the scope of this text.  One reason is that there is no systematic procedure for deciding whether two statements in predicate logic are logically equivalent (i.e., there is no analogue to truth tables here).  Rather, we end with a couple of examples of logical equivalence and deduction, to pique your interest.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-42}
\hypertarget{p-2382}{}%
Suppose we claim that there is no smallest number.  We can translate this into symbols as%
\begin{equation*}
\neg \exists x \forall y (x \le y)
\end{equation*}
(literally, ``it is not true that there is a number \(x\) such that for all numbers \(y\), \(x\) is less than or equal to \(y\)'').%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2383}{}%
However, we know how negation interacts with quantifiers: we can pass a negation over a quantifier by switching the quantifier type (between universal and existential).  So the statement above should be \emph{logically equivalent} to%
\begin{equation*}
\forall x \exists y (y \lt x).
\end{equation*}
Notice that \(y \lt x\) is the negation of \(x \le y\).  This literally says, ``for every number \(x\) there is a number \(y\) which is smaller than \(x\).''  We see that this is another way to make our original claim.%
\end{example}
\begin{example}[]\label{example-43}
\hypertarget{p-2384}{}%
Can you switch the order of quantifiers? For example, consider the two statements:%
\begin{equation*}
\forall x \exists y P(x,y) \qquad \mathrm{ and } \qquad \exists y \forall x P(x,y).
\end{equation*}
Are these logically equivalent?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-308}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-2385}{}%
These statements are NOT logically equivalent. To see this, we should provide an interpretation of the predicate \(P(x,y)\) which makes one of the statements true and the other false.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2386}{}%
Let \(P(x,y)\) be the predicate \(x \lt  y\). It is true, in the natural numbers, that for all \(x\) there is some \(y\) greater than it (since there are infinitely many numbers). However, there is not a natural number \(y\) which is greater than every number \(x\).  Thus it is possible for \(\forall x \exists y P(x,y)\) to be true while \(\exists y \forall x P(x,y)\) is false.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2387}{}%
We cannot do the reverse of this though. If there is some \(y\) for which every \(x\) satisfies \(P(x,y)\), then certainly for every \(x\) there is some \(y\) which satisfies \(P(x,y)\). The first is saying we can find one \(y\) that works for every \(x\). The second allows different \(y\)'s to work for different \(x\)'s, but there is nothing preventing us from using the same \(y\) that work for every \(x\).  In other words, while we don't have logical equivalence between the two statements, we do have a valid deduction rule:%
\begin{sidebyside}{1}{0}{0}{0}
\begin{sbspanel}{1}
{\centering%
\begin{tabular}{cc}
&\(\exists y \forall x P(x,y)\)\tabularnewline\hrulethin
\(\therefore\)&\(\forall x \exists y P(x,y)\)
\end{tabular}
\par}
\end{sbspanel}
\end{sidebyside}
\par
\hypertarget{p-2388}{}%
Put yet another way, this says that the single statement%
\begin{equation*}
\exists y \forall x P(x,y) \imp \forall x \exists y P(x,y)
\end{equation*}
is always true.  This is sort of like a tautology, although we reserve that term for necessary truths in propositional logic.  A statement in predicate logic that is necessarily true gets the more prestigious designation of a \terminology{law of logic}\index{law of logic} (or sometimes \terminology{logically valid}\index{logically valid|see{law of logic}}, but that is less fun).%

ab \amp =(2k)b\\

Thus \(ab\) is even.%
\item\hypertarget{li-506}{}\hypertarget{p-2446}{}%
Suppose that \(ab\) is even but \(a\) and \(b\) are both odd. Namely, \(ab = 2n\), \(a=2k+1\) and \(b=2j+1\) for some integers \(n\), \(k\), and \(j\). Then%

Anyone who doesn't believe there is creativity in mathematics clearly has not tried to write proofs. Finding a way to convince the world that a particular statement is necessarily true is a mighty undertaking and can often be quite challenging. There is not a guaranteed path to success in the search for proofs. For example, in the summer of 1742, a German mathematician by the name of Christian Goldbach wondered whether every even integer greater than 2 could be written as the sum of two primes. Centuries later, we still don't have a proof of this apparent fact (computers have checked that ``Goldbach's Conjecture'' holds for all numbers less than \(4\times 10^{18}\), which leaves only infinitely many more numbers to check).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2451}{}%
Writing proofs is a bit of an art. Like any art, to be truly great at it, you need some sort of inspiration, as well as some foundational technique. Just as musicians can learn proper fingering, and painters can learn the proper way to hold a brush, we can look at the proper way to construct arguments. A good place to start might be to study a classic.%
\begin{theorem}[{}]\label{theorem-18}
\hypertarget{p-2452}{}%
There are infinitely many primes.\index{prime numbers}%
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}\hypertarget{proof-12}{}
\hypertarget{p-2453}{}%
Suppose this were not the case. That is, suppose there are only finitely many primes. Then there must be a last, largest prime, call it \(p\). Consider the number%
\begin{equation*}
N = p! + 1 = (p \cdot (p-1) \cdot \cdots 3\cdot 2 \cdot 1) + 1.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2454}{}%
Now \(N\) is certainly larger than \(p\). Also, \(N\) is not divisible by any number less than or equal to \(p\), since every number less than or equal to \(p\) divides \(p!\). Thus the prime factorization of \(N\) contains prime numbers (possibly just \(N\) itself) all greater than \(p\). So \(p\) is not the largest prime, a contradiction. Therefore there are infinitely many primes.%
\end{proof}
\hypertarget{p-2455}{}%
This proof is an example of a \emph{proof by contradiction}, one of the standard styles of mathematical proof. First and foremost, the proof is an argument. It contains sequence of statements, the last being the \emph{conclusion} which follows from the previous statements. The argument is valid so the conclusion must be true if the premises are true.

\par
\hypertarget{p-2464}{}%
We should say a bit more about the last line. Up through line 8, we have a valid argument with the premise ``there are only finitely many primes'' and the conclusion ``there is a prime larger than the largest prime.'' This is a valid argument as each line follows from previous lines. So if the premises are true, then the conclusion \emph{must} be true. However, the conclusion is NOT true. The only way out: the premise must be false.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2465}{}%
The sort of line-by-line analysis we did above is a great way to really understand what is going on. Whenever you come across a proof in a textbook, you really should make sure you understand what each line is saying and why it is true. Additionally, it is equally important to understand the overall structure of the proof. This is where using tools from logic is helpful. Luckily there are a relatively small number of standard proof styles that keep showing up again and again. Being familiar with these can help understand proof, as well as give ideas of how to write your own.%

\par
\hypertarget{p-2467}{}%
The simplest (from a logic perspective) style of proof is a \terminology{direct proof}. Often all that is required to prove something is a systematic explanation of what everything means. Direct proofs are especially useful when proving implications. The general format to prove \(P \imp Q\) is this:%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-14}{}
\hypertarget{p-2468}{}%
Assume \(P\). Explain, explain, \textellipsis{}, explain. Therefore \(Q\).%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-2469}{}%
Often we want to prove universal statements, perhaps of the form \(\forall x (P(x) \imp Q(x))\). Again, we will want to assume \(P(x)\) is true and deduce \(Q(x)\). But what about the \(x\)? We want this to work for \emph{all} \(x\). We accomplish this by fixing \(x\) to be an arbitrary element (of the sort we are interested in).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2470}{}%
Here are a few examples. First, we will set up the proof structure for a direct proof, then fill in the details.%

The format of the proof with be this: Let \(n\) be an arbitrary integer. Assume that \(n\) is even. Explain explain explain. Therefore \(n^2\) is even.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2473}{}%
To fill in the details, we will basically just explain what it means for \(n\) to be even, and then see what that means for \(n^2\). Here is a complete proof.%
\begin{proof}\hypertarget{proof-13}{}
\hypertarget{p-2474}{}%
Let \(n\) be an arbitrary integer. Suppose \(n\) is even. Then \(n = 2k\) for some integer \(k\). Now \(n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 = 2(2k^2)\). Since \(2k^2\) is an integer, \(n^2\) is even.%
\end{proof}
\end{example}
\begin{example}[]\label{example-45}
\hypertarget{p-2475}{}%
Prove: For all integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), if \(a|b\) and \(b|c\) then \(a|c\). Here \(x|y\), read ``\(x\) divides \(y\)'' means that \(y\) is a multiple of \(x\) (so \(x\) will divide into \(y\) without remainder).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-316}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-2476}{}%
Even before we know what the divides symbol means, we can set up a direct proof for this statement. It will go something like this: Let \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) be arbitrary integers. Assume that \(a|b\) and \(b|c\). Dot dot dot. Therefore \(a|c\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2477}{}%
How do we connect the dots? We say what our hypothesis (\(a|b\) and \(b|c\)) really means and why this gives us what the conclusion (\(a|c\)) really means. Another way to say that \(a|b\) is to say that \(b = ka\) for some integer \(k\) (that is, that \(b\) is a multiple of \(a\)). What are we going for? That \(c = la\), for some integer \(l\) (because we want \(c\) to be a multiple of \(a\)). Here is the complete proof.%
\begin{proof}\hypertarget{proof-14}{}
\hypertarget{p-2478}{}%
Let \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) be integers. Assume that \(a|b\) and \(b|c\). In other words, \(b\) is a multiple of \(a\) and \(c\) is a multiple of \(b\). So there are integers \(k\) and \(j\) such that \(b = ka\) and \(c = jb\). Combining these (through substitution) we get that \(c = jka\). But \(jk\) is an integer, so this says that \(c\) is a multiple of \(a\). Therefore \(a|c\).%

Recall that an implication \(P \imp Q\) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive \(\neg Q \imp \neg P\). There are plenty of examples of statements which are hard to prove directly, but whose contrapositive can easily be proved directly. This is all that \terminology{proof by contrapositive} does. It gives a direct proof of the contrapositive of the implication. This is enough because the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2481}{}%
The skeleton of the proof of \(P \imp Q\) by contrapositive will always look roughly like this:%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-15}{}
\hypertarget{p-2482}{}%
Assume \(\neg Q\). Explain, explain, \textellipsis{} explain. Therefore \(\neg P\).%

As before, if there are variables and quantifiers, we set them to be arbitrary elements of our domain. Here are a couple examples:%

\hypertarget{p-2484}{}%
Is the statement ``for all integers \(n\), if \(n^2\) is even, then \(n\) is even'' true?%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-317}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-2485}{}%
This is the converse of the statement we proved above using a direct proof. From trying a few examples, this statement definitely appears this is true. So let's prove it.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2486}{}%
A direct proof of this statement would require fixing an arbitrary \(n\) and assuming that \(n^2\) is even. But it is not at all clear how this would allow us to conclude anything about \(n\). Just because \(n^2 = 2k\) does not in itself suggest how we could write \(n\) as a multiple of 2.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2487}{}%
Try something else: write the contrapositive of the statement. We get, for all integers \(n\), if \(n\) is odd then \(n^2\) is odd. This looks much more promising. Our proof will look something like this:%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2488}{}%
Let \(n\) be an arbitrary integer. Suppose that \(n\) is not even. This means that \textellipsis{}. In other words \textellipsis{}. But this is the same as saying \textellipsis{}. Therefore \(n^2\) is not even.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2489}{}%
Now we fill in the details:%
\begin{proof}\hypertarget{proof-15}{}
\hypertarget{p-2490}{}%
We will prove the contrapositive. Let \(n\) be an arbitrary integer. Suppose that \(n\) is not even, and thus odd. Then \(n= 2k+1\) for some integer \(k\). Now \(n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1\). Since \(2k^2 + 2k\) is an integer, we see that \(n^2\) is odd and therefore not even.%

\begin{example}[]\label{example-47}

\hypertarget{p-2492}{}%
The problem with trying a direct proof is that it will be hard to separate \(a\) and \(b\) from knowing something about \(a+b\). On the other hand, if we know something about \(a\) and \(b\) separately, then combining them might give us information about \(a+b\). The contrapositive of the statement we are trying to prove is: for all integers \(a\) and \(b\), if \(a\) and \(b\) are even, then \(a+b\) is even. Thus our proof will have the following format:%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2493}{}%
Let \(a\) and \(b\) be integers. Assume that \(a\) and \(b\) are both even. la la la. Therefore \(a+b\) is even.%

Let \(a\) and \(b\) be integers. Assume that \(a\) and \(b\) are even. Then \(a = 2k\) and \(b = 2l\) for some integers \(k\) and \(l\). Now \(a + b = 2k + 2l = 2(k+1)\). Since \(k + l\) is an integer, we see that \(a + b\) is even, completing the proof.%
\end{proof}
\hypertarget{p-2496}{}%
Note that our assumption that \(a\) and \(b\) are even is really the negation of \(a\) or \(b\) is odd. We used De Morgan's law here.%
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-2497}{}%
We have seen how to prove some statements in the form of implications: either directly or by contrapositive. Some statements are not written as implications to begin with.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-48}
\hypertarget{p-2498}{}%
Consider the statement, for every prime number \(p\), either \(p = 2\) or \(p\) is odd. We can rephrase this: for every prime number \(p\), if \(p \ne 2\), then \(p\) is odd. Now try to prove it.%

\begin{proof}\hypertarget{proof-17}{}
\hypertarget{p-2499}{}%
Let \(p\) be an arbitrary prime number. Assume \(p\) is not odd. So \(p\) is divisible by 2. Since \(p\) is prime, it must have exactly two divisors, and it has 2 as a divisor, so \(p\) must be divisible by only 1 and 2. Therefore \(p = 2\). This completes the proof (by contrapositive).%

There might be statements which really cannot be rephrased as implications. For example, ``\(\sqrt 2\) is irrational.'' In this case, it is hard to know where to start. What can we assume? Well, say we want to prove the statement \(P\). What if we could prove that \(\neg P \imp Q\) where \(Q\) was false? If this implication is true, and \(Q\) is false, what can we say about \(\neg P\)? It must be false as well, which makes \(P\) true!%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2502}{}%
This is why \terminology{proof by contradiction} works. If we can prove that \(\neg P\) leads to a contradiction, then the only conclusion is that \(\neg P\) is false, so \(P\) is true. That's what we wanted to prove. In other words, if it is impossible for \(P\) to be false, \(P\) must be true.%

\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-320}{}\quad%
\begin{proof}\hypertarget{proof-18}{}
\hypertarget{p-2505}{}%
Suppose not. Then \(\sqrt 2\) is equal to a fraction \(\frac{a}{b}\). Without loss of generality, assume \(\frac{a}{b}\) is in lowest terms (otherwise reduce the fraction). So,%
\begin{equation*}
2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}
\end{equation*}
%
\begin{equation*}
2b^2 = a^2
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2506}{}%
Thus \(a^2\) is even, and as such \(a\) is even. So \(a = 2k\) for some integer \(k\), and \(a^2 = 4k^2\). We then have,%
\begin{equation*}
2b^2 = 4k^2

%
\begin{equation*}
b^2 = 2k^2

Thus \(b^2\) is even, and as such \(b\) is even. Since \(a\) is also even, we see that \(\frac{a}{b}\) is not in lowest terms, a contradiction. Thus \(\sqrt 2\) is irrational.%

We proceed by contradiction. So suppose there \emph{are} integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x^2 = 4y + 2 = 2(2y + 1)\). So \(x^2\) is even. We have seen that this implies that \(x\) is even. So \(x = 2k\) for some integer \(k\). Then \(x^2 = 4k^2\). This in turn gives \(2k^2 = (2y + 1)\). But \(2k^2\) is even, and \(2y + 1\) is odd, so these cannot be equal. Thus we have a contradiction, so there must not be any integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x^2 = 4y + 2\).%

Suppose, contrary to stipulation, that each of the pigeon holes contain at most one pigeon. Then at most, there will be \(n\) pigeons. But we assumed that there are more than \(n\) pigeons, so this is impossible. Thus there must be a pigeonhole with more than one pigeon.%
\end{proof}
\hypertarget{p-2512}{}%
While we phrased this proof as a proof by contradiction, we could have also used a proof by contrapositive since our contradiction was simply the negation of the hypothesis.

It is almost NEVER okay to prove a statement with just an example. Certainly none of the statements proved above can be proved through an example. This is because in each of those cases we are trying to prove that something holds of all integers. We claim that \(n^2\) being even implies that \(n\) is even, \emph{no matter what integer} \(n\) we pick. Showing that this works for \(n = 4\) is not even close to enough.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2515}{}%
This cannot be stressed enough. If you are trying to prove a statement of the form \(\forall x P(x)\), you absolutely CANNOT prove this with an example.\footnote{This is not to say that looking at examples is a waste of time. Doing so will often give you an idea of how to write a proof. But the examples do not belong in the proof.\label{fn-23}}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2516}{}%
However, existential statements can be proven this way. If we want to prove that there is an integer \(n\) such that \(n^2-n+41\) is not prime, all we need to do is find one. This might seem like a silly thing to want to prove until you try a few values for \(n\).%

So far we have gotten only primes. You might be tempted to conjecture, ``For all positive integers \(n\), the number \(n^2 - n + 41\) is prime.'' If you wanted to prove this, you would need to use a direct proof, a proof by contrapositive, or another style of proof, but certainly it is not enough to give even 7 examples. In fact, we can prove this conjecture is \emph{false} by proving its negation: ``There is a positive integer \(n\) such that \(n^2 - n + 41\) is not prime.'' Since this is an existential statement, it suffices to show that there does indeed exist such a number.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2518}{}%
In fact, we can quickly see that \(n = 41\) will give \(41^2\) which is certainly not prime. You might say that this is a counterexample to the conjecture that \(n^2 - n + 41\) is always prime. Since so many statements in mathematics are universal, making their negations existential, we can often prove that a statement is false (if it is) by providing a counterexample.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-52}

\hypertarget{p-2520}{}%
The converse is the statement, ``for all integers \(a\) and \(b\), if \(a\) is odd or \(b\) is odd, then \(a + b\) is odd.'' This is false! How do we prove it is false? We need to prove the negation of the converse. Let's look at the symbols. The converse is%
\begin{equation*}
\forall a \forall b ((O(a) \vee O(b)) \imp O(a+b)).
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2521}{}%
We want to prove the negation:%
\begin{equation*}
\neg \forall a \forall b ((O(a) \vee O(b)) \imp O(a+b)).
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2522}{}%
Simplify using the rules from the previous sections:%
\begin{equation*}
\exists a \exists b ((O(a) \vee O(b)) \wedge \neg O(a+b)).
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2523}{}%
As the negation passed by the quantifiers, they changed from \(\forall\) to \(\exists\). We then needed to take the negation of an implication, which is equivalent to asserting the if part and not the then part.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2524}{}%
Now we know what to do. To prove that the converse is false we need to find two integers \(a\) and \(b\) so that \(a\) is odd or \(b\) is odd, but \(a+b\) is not odd (so even). That's easy: 1 and 3. (remember, ``or'' means one or the other or both). Both of these are odd, but \(1+3 = 4\) is not odd.%

We could go on and on and on about different proof styles (we haven't even mentioned induction or combinatorial proofs here), but instead we will end with one final useful technique: proof by cases. The idea is to prove that \(P\) is true by proving that \(Q \imp P\) and \(\neg Q \imp P\) for some statement \(Q\). So no matter what, whether or not \(Q\) is true, we know that \(P\) is true. In fact, we could generalize this. Suppose we want to prove \(P\). We know that at least one of the statements \(Q_1, Q_2, \ldots, Q_n\) are true. If we can show that \(Q_1 \imp P\) and \(Q_2 \imp P\) and so on all the way to \(Q_n \imp P\), then we can conclude \(P\). The key thing is that we want to be sure that one of our cases (the \(Q_i\)'s) must be true no matter what.%

\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-324}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-2529}{}%
It is hard to know where to start this, because we don't know much of anything about \(n\). We might be able to prove that \(n^3 - n\) is even if we knew that \(n\) was even. In fact, we could probably prove that \(n^3-n\) was even if \(n\) was odd. But since \(n\) must either be even or odd, this will be enough. Here's the proof.%
\begin{proof}\hypertarget{proof-21}{}
\hypertarget{p-2530}{}%
We consider two cases: if \(n\) is even or if \(n\) is odd.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2531}{}%
Case 1: \(n\) is even. Then \(n = 2k\) for some integer \(k\). This give%
\begin{align*}
n^3 - n \amp = 8k^3 - 2k\\
\amp = 2(4k^2 - k),
\end{align*}
and since \(4k^2 - k\) is an integer, this says that \(n^3-n\) is even.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2532}{}%
Case 2: \(n\) is odd. Then \(n = 2k+1\) for some integer \(k\). This gives%
\begin{align*}
n^3 - n \amp = (2k+1)^3 - (2k+1)\\
\amp = 8k^3 + 6k^2 + 6k + 1 - 2k - 1\\
\amp = 2(4k^3 + 3k^2 + 2k),
\end{align*}
and since \(4k^3 + 3k^2 + 2k\) is an integer, we see that \(n^3 - n\) is even again.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2533}{}%
Since \(n^3 - n\) is even in both exhaustive cases, we see that \(n^3 - n\) is indeed always even.%

\hypertarget{p-2621}{}%
\index{induction} Mathematical induction is a proof technique, not unlike direct proof or proof by contradiction or combinatorial proof. In other words, induction is a style of argument we use to convince ourselves and others that a mathematical statement is always true. Many mathematical statements can be proved by simply explaining what they mean. Others are very difficult to prove\textemdash{}in fact, there are relatively simple mathematical statements which nobody yet knows how to prove. To facilitate the discovery of proofs, it is important to be familiar with some standard styles of arguments. Induction is one such style. Let's start with an example:%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Subsection B.6.1 Stamps}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{Stamps}]{Stamps}\label{subsec_induction-stamps}
\begin{activity}[]\label{activity-321}
\hypertarget{p-2622}{}%
You need to mail a package, but don't yet know how much postage you will need. You have a large supply of 8-cent stamps and 5-cent stamps. Which amounts of postage can you make exactly using these stamps? Which amounts are impossible to make?%
\end{activity}
\hypertarget{p-2623}{}%
Perhaps in investigating the problem above you picked some amounts of postage, and then figured out whether you could make that amount using just 8-cent and 5-cent stamps. Perhaps you did this in order: can you make 1 cent of postage? Can you make 2 cents? 3 cents? And so on. If this is what you did, you were actually answering a \emph{sequence} of questions. We have methods for dealing with sequences. Let's see if that helps.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2624}{}%
Actually, we will not make a sequence of questions, but rather a sequence of statements. Let \(P(n)\)\label{notation-36}
 be the statement ``you can make \(n\) cents of postage using just 8-cent and 5-cent stamps.'' Since for each value of \(n\), \(P(n)\) is a statement, it is either true or false. So if we form the sequence of statements%
\begin{equation*}
P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4), \ldots
\end{equation*}
the sequence will consist of \(T\)'s (for true) and \(F\)'s (for false). In our particular case the sequence starts%
\begin{equation*}
F,F,F,F,T,F,F,T,F,F,T,F,F,T,\ldots
\end{equation*}
because \(P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4)\) are all false (you cannot make 1, 2, 3, or 4 cents of postage) but \(P(5)\) is true (use one 5-cent stamp), and so on.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2625}{}%
Let's think a bit about how we could find the value of \(P(n)\) for some specific \(n\) (the ``value'' will be either \(T\) or \(F\)). How did we find the value of the \(n\)th term of a sequence of numbers? How did we find \(a_n\)? There were two ways we could do this: either there was a closed formula for \(a_n\), so we could plug in \(n\) into the formula and get our output value, or we had a recursive definition for the sequence, so we could use the previous terms of the sequence to compute the \(n\)th term. When dealing with sequences of statements, we could use either of these techniques as well. Maybe there is a way to use \(n\) itself to determine whether we can make \(n\) cents of postage. That would be something like a closed formula. Or instead we could use the previous terms in the sequence (of statements) to determine whether we can make \(n\) cents of postage. That is, if we know the value of \(P(n-1)\), can we get from that to the value of \(P(n)\)? That would be something like a recursive definition for the sequence. Remember, finding recursive definitions for sequences was often easier than finding closed formulas. The same is true here.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2626}{}%
Suppose I told you that \(P(43)\) was true (it is). Can you determine from this fact the value of \(P(44)\) (whether it true or false)? Yes you can. Even if we don't know how exactly we made 43 cents out of the 5-cent and 8-cent stamps, we do know that there was some way to do it. What if that way used at least three 5-cent stamps (making 15 cents)? We could replace those three 5-cent stamps with two 8-cent stamps (making 16 cents). The total postage has gone up by 1, so we have a way to make 44 cents, so \(P(44)\) is true. Of course, we assumed that we had at least three 5-cent stamps. What if we didn't? Then we must have at least three 8-cent stamps (making 24 cents). If we replace those three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent stamps (making 25 cents) then again we have bumped up our total by 1 cent so we can make 44 cents, so \(P(44)\) is true.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2627}{}%
Notice that we have not said how to make 44 cents, just that we can, on the basis that we can make 43 cents. How do we know we can make 43 cents? Perhaps because we know we can make \(42\)\label{notation-37}
 cents, which we know we can do because we know we can make 41 cents, and so on. It's a recursion! As with a recursive definition of a numerical sequence, we must specify our initial value. In this case, the initial value is ``\(P(1)\) is false.'' That's not good, since our recurrence relation just says that \(P(k+1)\) is true \emph{if} \(P(k)\) is also true. We need to start the process with a true \(P(k)\). So instead, we might want to use ``\(P(31)\) is true'' as the initial condition.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2628}{}%
Putting this all together we arrive at the following fact: it is possible to (exactly) make any amount of postage greater than 27 cents using just 5-cent and 8-cent stamps.\footnote{This is not claiming that there are no amounts less than 27 cents which can also be made.\label{fn-24}} In other words, \(P(k)\) is true for any \(k \ge 28\). To prove this, we could do the following: \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-556}{}\hypertarget{p-2629}{}%
Demonstrate that \(P(28)\) is true.%
\item\hypertarget{li-557}{}\hypertarget{p-2630}{}%
Prove that if \(P(k)\) is true, then \(P(k+1)\) is true (for any \(k \ge 28\)).%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2631}{}%
Suppose we have done this. Then we know that the 28th term of the sequence above is a \(T\) (using step 1, the initial condition or \terminology{base case}), and that every term after the 28th is \(T\) also (using step 2, the recursive part or \terminology{inductive case}). Here is what the proof would actually look like.%
\begin{proof}\hypertarget{proof-29}{}
\hypertarget{p-2632}{}%
Let \(P(n)\) be the statement ``it is possible to make exactly \(n\) cents of postage using 5-cent and 8-cent stamps.'' We will show \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 28\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2633}{}%
First, we show that \(P(28)\) is true: \(28 =  4 \cdot 5+ 1\cdot 8\), so we can make \(28\) cents using four 5-cent stamps and one 8-cent stamp.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2634}{}%
Now suppose \(P(k)\) is true for some arbitrary \(k \ge 28\). Then it is possible to make \(k\) cents using 5-cent and 8-cent stamps. Note that since \(k \ge 28\), it cannot be that we use less than three 5-cent stamps \emph{and} less than three 8-cent stamps: using two of each would give only 26 cents. Now if we have made \(k\) cents using at least three 5-cent stamps, replace three 5-cent stamps by two 8-cent stamps. This replaces 15 cents of postage with 16 cents, moving from a total of \(k\) cents to \(k+1\) cents. Thus \(P(k+1)\) is true. On the other hand, if we have made \(k\) cents using at least three 8-cent stamps, then we can replace three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent stamps, moving from 24 cents to 25 cents, giving a total of \(k+1\) cents of postage. So in this case as well \(P(k+1)\) is true.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2635}{}%
Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 28\).%
\end{proof}

\typeout{Subsection B.6.2 Formalizing Proofs}
\typeout{************************************************}
\subsection[{Formalizing Proofs}]{Formalizing Proofs}\label{subsec_induction-formproofs}
\hypertarget{p-2636}{}%
What we did in the stamp example above works for many types of problems. Proof by induction is useful when trying to prove statements about all natural numbers, or all natural numbers greater than some fixed first case (like 28 in the example above), and in some other situations too. In particular, induction should be used when there is some way to go from one case to the next \textendash{} when you can see how to always ``do one more.''%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2637}{}%
This is a big idea. Thinking about a problem \emph{inductively} can give new insight into the problem. For example, to really understand the stamp problem, you should think about how any amount of postage (greater than 28 cents) can be made (this is non-inductive reasoning) and also how the ways in which postage can be made \emph{changes} as the amount increases (inductive reasoning). When you are asked to provide a proof by induction, you are being asked to think about the problem \emph{dynamically}; how does increasing \(n\) change the problem?%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2638}{}%
But there is another side to proofs by induction as well. In mathematics, it is not enough to understand a problem, you must also be able to communicate the problem to others. Like any discipline, mathematics has standard language and style, allowing mathematicians to share their ideas efficiently. Proofs by induction have a certain formal style, and being able to write in this style is important. It allows us to keep our ideas organized and might even help us with formulating a proof.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2639}{}%
Here is the general structure of a proof by mathematical induction:%
\begin{assemblage}[Induction Proof Structure]\label{assemblage-24}
\hypertarget{p-2640}{}%
\index{induction} Start by saying what the statement is that you want to prove: ``Let \(P(n)\) be the statement\textellipsis{}'' To prove that \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 0\), you must prove two facts: \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-558}{}\hypertarget{p-2641}{}%
Base case: Prove that \(P(0)\) is true. You do this directly. This is often easy.%
\item\hypertarget{li-559}{}\hypertarget{p-2642}{}%
Inductive case: Prove that \(P(k) \imp P(k+1)\) for all \(k \ge 0\). That is, prove that for any \(k \ge 0\) if \(P(k)\) is true, then \(P(k+1)\) is true as well. This is the proof of an if \textellipsis{} then \textellipsis{} statement, so you can assume \(P(k)\) is true (\(P(k)\) is called the \emph{inductive hypothesis}\index{inductive hypothesis}). You must then explain why \(P(k+1)\) is also true, given that assumption.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2643}{}%
Assuming you are successful on both parts above, you can conclude, ``Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 0\).''%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-2644}{}%
Sometimes the statement \(P(n)\) will only be true for values of \(n \ge 4\), for example, or some other value. In such cases, replace all the 0's above with 4's (or the other value).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2645}{}%
The other advantage of formalizing inductive proofs is it allows us to verify that the logic behind this style of argument is valid. Why does induction work? Think of a row of dominoes set up standing on their edges. We want to argue that in a minute, all the dominoes will have fallen down. For this to happen, you will need to push the first domino. That is the base case. It will also have to be that the dominoes are close enough together that when any particular domino falls, it will cause the next domino to fall. That is the inductive case. If both of these conditions are met, you push the first domino over and each domino will cause the next to fall, then all the dominoes will fall.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2646}{}%
Induction is powerful! Think how much easier it is to knock over dominoes when you don't have to push over each domino yourself. You just start the chain reaction, and the rely on the relative nearness of the dominoes to take care of the rest.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2647}{}%
Think about our study of sequences. It is easier to find recursive definitions for sequences than closed formulas. Going from one case to the next is easier than going directly to a particular case. That is what is so great about induction. Instead of going directly to the (arbitrary) case for \(n\), we just need to say how to get from one case to the next.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2648}{}%
When you are asked to prove a statement by mathematical induction, you should first think about \emph{why} the statement is true, using inductive reasoning. Explain why induction is the right thing to do, and roughly why the inductive case will work. Then, sit down and write out a careful, formal proof using the structure above.%
\typeout{************************************************}

\subsection[{Examples}]{Examples}\label{subsec_induction-examples}
\hypertarget{p-2649}{}%
Here are some examples of proof by mathematical induction.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-54}
\hypertarget{p-2650}{}%
Prove for each natural number \(n \ge 1\) that \(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-332}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-2651}{}%
First, let's think inductively about this equation. In fact, we know this is true for other reasons (reverse and add comes to mind). But why might induction be applicable? The left-hand side adds up the numbers from 1 to \(n\). If we know how to do that, adding just one more term (\(n+1\)) would not be that hard. For example, if \(n = 100\), suppose we know that the sum of the first 100 numbers is \(5050\) (so \(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 100 = 5050\), which is true). Now to find the sum of the first 101 numbers, it makes more sense to just add 101 to 5050, instead of computing the entire sum again. We would have \(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 100 + 101 = 5050 + 101 = 5151\). In fact, it would always be easy to add just one more term. This is why we should use induction.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2652}{}%
Now the formal proof:%
\begin{proof}\hypertarget{proof-30}{}
\hypertarget{p-2653}{}%
Let \(P(n)\) be the statement \(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+2)}{2}\). We will show that \(P(n)\) is true for all natural numbers \(n \ge 1\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2654}{}%
Base case: \(P(1)\) is the statement \(1 = \frac{1(1+1)}{2}\) which is clearly true.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2655}{}%
Inductive case: Let \(k \ge 1\) be a natural number. Assume (for induction) that \(P(k)\) is true. That means \(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}\). We will prove that \(P(k+1)\) is true as well. That is, we must prove that \(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k + (k+1) = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}\). To prove this equation, start by adding \(k+1\) to both sides of the inductive hypothesis:%
\begin{equation*}
1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k + (k+1) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1).
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2656}{}%
Now, simplifying the right side we get:%
\begin{align*}
\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + k+1 \amp = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + \frac{2(k+1)}{2}\\
\amp = \frac{k(k+1) + 2(k+1)}{2}\\
\amp = \frac{(k+2)(k+1)}{2}.
\end{align*}

Thus \(P(k+1)\) is true, so by the principle of mathematical induction \(P(n)\) is true for all natural numbers \(n \ge 1\).%
\end{proof}
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-2658}{}%
Note that in the part of the proof in which we proved \(P(k+1)\) from \(P(k)\), we used the equation \(P(k)\). This was the inductive hypothesis. Seeing how to use the inductive hypotheses is usually straight forward when proving a fact about a sum like this. In other proofs, it can be less obvious where it fits in.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-55}
\hypertarget{p-2659}{}%
Prove that for all \(n \in \N\), \(6^n - 1\) is a multiple of 5.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-333}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-2660}{}%
Again, start by understanding the dynamics of the problem. What does increasing \(n\) do? Let's try with a few examples. If \(n = 1\), then yes, \(6^1 - 1 = 5\) is a multiple of 5. What does incrementing \(n\) to 2 look like? We get \(6^2 - 1 = 35\), which again is a multiple of 5. Next, \(n = 3\): but instead of just finding \(6^3 - 1\), what did the increase in \(n\) do? We will still subtract 1, but now we are multiplying by another 6 first. Viewed another way, we are multiplying a number which is one more than a multiple of 5 by 6 (because \(6^2 - 1\) is a multiple of 5, so \(6^2\) is one more than a multiple of 5). What do numbers which are one more than a multiple of 5 look like? They must have last digit 1 or 6. What happens when you multiply such a number by 6? Depends on the number, but in any case, the last digit of the new number must be a 6. And then if you subtract 1, you get last digit 5, so a multiple of 5.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2661}{}%
The point is, every time we multiply by just one more six, we still get a number with last digit 6, so subtracting 1 gives us a multiple of 5. Now the formal proof:%
\begin{proof}\hypertarget{proof-31}{}
\hypertarget{p-2662}{}%
Let \(P(n)\) be the statement, ``\(6^n - 1\) is a multiple of 5.'' We will prove that \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \in \N\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2663}{}%
Base case: \(P(0)\) is true: \(6^0 -1 = 0\) which is a multiple of 5.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2664}{}%
Inductive case: Let \(k\) be an arbitrary natural number. Assume, for induction, that \(P(k)\) is true. That is, \(6^k - 1\) is a multiple of \(5\). Then \(6^k - 1 = 5j\) for some integer \(j\). This means that \(6^k = 5j + 1\). Multiply both sides by \(6\):%
\begin{equation*}
6^{k+1} = 6(5j+1) = 30j + 6.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2665}{}%
But we want to know about \(6^{k+1} - 1\), so subtract 1 from both sides:%
\begin{equation*}
6^{k+1} - 1 = 30j + 5.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2666}{}%
Of course \(30j+5 = 5(6j+1)\), so is a multiple of 5.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2667}{}%
Therefore \(6^{k+1} - 1\) is a multiple of 5, or in other words, \(P(k+1)\) is true. Thus, by the principle of mathematical induction \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \in \N\).%
\end{proof}
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-2668}{}%
We had to be a little bit clever (i.e., use some algebra) to locate the \(6^k - 1\) inside of \(6^{k+1} - 1\) before we could apply the inductive hypothesis. This is what can make inductive proofs challenging.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2669}{}%
In the two examples above, we started with \(n = 1\) or \(n = 0\). We can start later if we need to.%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-56}
\hypertarget{p-2670}{}%
Prove that \(n^2 \lt  2^n\) for all integers \(n \ge 5\).%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-334}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-2671}{}%
First, the idea of the argument. What happens when we increase \(n\) by 1? On the left-hand side, we increase the base of the square and go to the next square number. On the right-hand side, we increase the power of 2. This means we double the number. So the question is, how does doubling a number relate to increasing to the next square? Think about what the difference of two consecutive squares looks like. We have \((n+1)^2 - n^2\). This factors:%
\begin{equation*}
(n+1)^2 - n^2 = (n+1-n)(n+1+n) = 2n+1.
\end{equation*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2672}{}%
But doubling the right-hand side increases it by \(2^n\), since \(2^{n+1} = 2^n + 2^n\). When \(n\) is large enough, \(2^n > 2n + 1\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2673}{}%
What we are saying here is that each time \(n\) increases, the left-hand side grows by less than the right-hand side. So if the left-hand side starts smaller (as it does when \(n = 5\)), it will never catch up. Now the formal proof:%
\begin{proof}\hypertarget{proof-32}{}
\hypertarget{p-2674}{}%
Let \(P(n)\) be the statement \(n^2 \lt  2^n\). We will prove \(P(n)\) is true for all integers \(n \ge 5\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2675}{}%
Base case: \(P(5)\) is the statement \(5^2 \lt  2^5\). Since \(5^2 = 25\) and \(2^5 = 32\), we see that \(P(5)\) is indeed true.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2676}{}%
Inductive case: Let \(k \ge 5\) be an arbitrary integer. Assume, for induction, that \(P(k)\) is true. That is, assume \(k^2 \lt  2^k\). We will prove that \(P(k+1)\) is true, i.e., \((k+1)^2 \lt  2^{k+1}\). To prove such an inequality, start with the left-hand side and work towards the right-hand side:%
\begin{align*}
(k+1)^2 \amp = k^2 + 2k + 1 \amp\\
\amp \lt 2^k + 2k + 1 \amp \ldots\text{by the inductive hypothesis.}\\
\amp \lt 2^k + 2^k \amp \ldots\text{ since } 2k + 1 \lt  2^k \text{ for }k \ge 5.\\
\amp = 2^{k+1}. \amp
\end{align*}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2677}{}%
Following the equalities and inequalities through, we get \((k+1)^2 \lt  2^{k+1}\), in other words, \(P(k+1)\). Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 5\).%
\end{proof}
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-2678}{}%
The previous example might remind you of the \emph{racetrack principle} from calculus, which says that if \(f(a) \lt  g(a)\), and \(f'(x) \lt  g'(x)\) for \(x > a\), then \(f(x) \lt  g(x)\) for \(x > a\). Same idea: the larger function is increasing at a faster rate than the smaller function, so the larger function will stay larger. In discrete math, we don't have derivatives, so we look at differences. Thus induction is the way to go.%

\hypertarget{p-2679}{}%
With great power, comes great responsibility. Induction isn't magic. It seems very powerful to be able to assume \(P(k)\) is true. After all, we are trying to prove \(P(n)\) is true and the only difference is in the variable: \(k\) vs. \(n\). Are we assuming that what we want to prove is true? Not really. We assume \(P(k)\) is true only for the sake of proving that \(P(k+1)\) is true.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2680}{}%
Still you might start to believe that you can prove anything with induction. Consider this incorrect ``proof'' that every Canadian\index{Canadians} has the same eye color: Let \(P(n)\) be the statement that any \(n\) Canadians have the same eye color. \(P(1)\) is true, since everyone has the same eye color as themselves. Now assume \(P(k)\) is true. That is, assume that in any group of \(k\) Canadians, everyone has the same eye color. Now consider an arbitrary group of \(k+1\) Canadians. The first \(k\) of these must all have the same eye color, since \(P(k)\) is true. Also, the last \(k\) of these must have the same eye color, since \(P(k)\) is true. So in fact, everyone the group must have the same eye color. Thus \(P(k+1)\) is true. So by the principle of mathematical induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2681}{}%
Clearly something went wrong. The problem is that the proof that \(P(k)\) implies \(P(k+1)\) assumes that \(k \ge 2\). We have only shown \(P(1)\) is true. In fact, \(P(2)\) is false.%

Start with a square piece of paper. You want to cut this square into smaller squares, leaving no waste (every piece of paper you end up with must be a square). Obviously it is possible to cut the square into 4 squares. You can also cut it into 9 squares. It turns out you can cut the square into 7 squares (although not all the same size). What other numbers of squares could you end up with?%
\end{investigation}
\hypertarget{p-2683}{}%
Sometimes, to prove that \(P(k+1)\) is true, it would be helpful to know that \(P(k)\) \emph{and} \(P(k-1)\) \emph{and} \(P(k-2)\) are all true. Consider the following puzzle:%
\begin{quote}\hypertarget{blockquote-17}{}
\hypertarget{p-2684}{}%
You have a rectangular chocolate bar, made up of \(n\) identical squares of chocolate.  You can take such a bar and break it along any row or column.  How many times will you have to break the bar to reduce it to \(n\) single chocolate squares?%
\end{quote}
\hypertarget{p-2685}{}%
At first, this question might seem impossible.  Perhaps I meant to ask for the \emph{smallest} number of breaks needed?  Let's investigate.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2686}{}%
Start with some small cases.  If \(n=2\), you must have a \(1\times 2\) rectangle, which can be reduced to single pieces in one break.  With \(n=3\), we must have a \(1\times 3\) bar, which requires two breaks: the first break creates a single square and a \(1\times 2\) bar, which we know takes one (more) break.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2687}{}%
What about \(n=4\)?  Now we could have a \(2\times 2\) bar, or a \(1 \times 4\) bar.  In the first case, break the bar into two \(2\times 2\) bars, each which require one more break (that's a total of three breaks required).  If we started with a \(1 \times 4\) bar, we have choices for our first break.  We could break the bar in half, creating two \(1\times 2\) bars, or we could break off a single square, leaving a \(1\times 3\) bar.  But either way, we still need two more breaks, giving a total of three.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2688}{}%
It is starting to look like no matter how we break the bar (and no matter how the \(n\) squares are arranged into a rectangle), we will always have the same number of breaks required.  It also looks like that number is one less than \(n\):%
\begin{conjecture}[{}]\label{conjecture-1}
\hypertarget{p-2689}{}%
Given a \(n\)-square rectangular chocolate bar, it always takes \(n-1\) breaks to reduce the bar to single squares.%
\end{conjecture}
\hypertarget{p-2690}{}%
It makes sense to prove this by induction because after breaking the bar once, you are left with \emph{smaller} chocolate bars.  Reducing to smaller cases is what induction is all about.  We can inductively assume we already know how to deal with these smaller bars.  The problem is, if we are trying to prove the inductive case about a \((k+1)\)-square bar, we don't know that after the first break the remaining bar will have \(k\) squares.  So we really need to assume that our conjecture is true for all cases less than \(k+1\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2691}{}%
Is it valid to make this stronger assumption?  Remember, in induction we are attempting to prove that \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n\).  What if that were not the case?  Then there would be some first \(n_0\) for which \(P(n_0)\) was false.  Since \(n_0\) is the \emph{first} counterexample, we know that \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \lt n_0\).  Now we proceed to prove that \(P(n_0)\) is actually true, based on the assumption that \(P(n)\) is true for all smaller \(n\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2692}{}%
This is quite an advantage: we now have a stronger inductive hypothesis. We can assume that \(P(1)\), \(P(2)\), \(P(3)\), \textellipsis{} \(P(k)\) is true, just to show that \(P(k+1)\) is true. Previously, we just assumed \(P(k)\) for this purpose.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2693}{}%
It is slightly easier if we change our variables for strong induction. Here is what the formal proof would look like:%
\begin{assemblage}[Strong Induction Proof Structure]\label{assemblage-25}
\hypertarget{p-2694}{}%
Again, start by saying what you want to prove: ``Let \(P(n)\) be the statement\textellipsis{}'' Then establish two facts: \leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}
\item\hypertarget{li-560}{}\hypertarget{p-2695}{}%
Base case: Prove that \(P(0)\) is true.%
\item\hypertarget{li-561}{}\hypertarget{p-2696}{}%
Inductive case: Assume \(P(k)\) is true for all \(k \lt  n\). Prove that \(P(n)\) is true.%
\end{enumerate}
 Conclude, ``therefore, by strong induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \gt 0\).''%
\end{assemblage}
\hypertarget{p-2697}{}%
Of course, it is acceptable to replace 0 with a larger base case if needed.\footnote{Technically, strong induction does not require you to prove a separate base case. This is because when proving the inductive case, you must show that \(P(0)\) is true, assuming \(P(k)\) is true for all \(k \lt  0\). But this is not any help so you end up proving \(P(0)\) anyway. To be on the safe side, we will always include the base case separately.\label{fn-25}}%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2698}{}%
Let's prove our conjecture about the chocolate bar puzzle:%
\begin{proof}\hypertarget{proof-33}{}
\hypertarget{p-2699}{}%
Let \(P(n)\) be the statement, ``it takes \(n-1\) breaks to reduce a \(n\)-square chocolate bar to single squares.''%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2700}{}%
Base case: Consider \(P(2)\). The squares must be arranged into a \(1\times 2\) rectangle, and we require \(2-1 = 1\) breaks to reduce this to single squares.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2701}{}%
Inductive case: Fix an arbitrary \(n\ge 2\) and assume \(P(k)\) is true for all \(k \lt n\).  Consider a \(n\)-square rectangular chocolate bar.  Break the bar once along any row or column.  This results in two chocolate bars, say of sizes \(a\) and \(b\).  That is, we have an \(a\)-square rectangular chocolate bar, a \(b\)-square rectangular chocolate bar, and \(a+b = n\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2702}{}%
We also know that \(a \lt n\) and \(b \lt n\), so by our inductive hypothesis, \(P(a)\) and \(P(b)\) are true.  To reduce the \(a\)-sqaure bar to single squares takes \(a-1\) breaks; to reduce the \(b\)-square bar to single squares takes \(b-1\) breaks.  Doing this results in our original bar being reduced to single squares.  All together it took the initial break, plus the \(a-1\) and \(b-1\) breaks, for a total of \(1+a-1+b-1 = a+b-1 = n-1\) breaks.  Thus \(P(n)\) is true.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2703}{}%
Therefore, by strong induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 2\).%
\end{proof}
\hypertarget{p-2704}{}%
Here is a more mathematically relevant example:%
\begin{example}[]\label{example-57}
\hypertarget{p-2705}{}%
Prove that any natural number greater than 1 is either prime\index{prime numbers} or can be written as the product of primes.%
\par\smallskip%
\noindent\textbf{Solution.}\hypertarget{solution-335}{}\quad%
\hypertarget{p-2706}{}%
First, the idea: if we take some number \(n\), maybe it is prime. If so, we are done. If not, then it is composite, so it is the product of two smaller numbers. Each of these factors is smaller than \(n\) (but at least 2), so we can repeat the argument with these numbers. We have reduced to a smaller case.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2707}{}%
Now the formal proof:%
\begin{proof}\hypertarget{proof-34}{}
\hypertarget{p-2708}{}%
Let \(P(n)\) be the statement, ``\(n\) is either prime or can be written as the product of primes.'' We will prove \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 2\).%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2709}{}%
Base case: \(P(2)\) is true because \(2\) is indeed prime.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2710}{}%
Inductive case: assume \(P(k)\) is true for all \(k \lt  n\). We want to show that \(P(n)\) is true. That is, we want to show that \(n\) is either prime or is the product of primes. If \(n\) is prime, we are done. If not, then \(n\) has more than 2 divisors, so we can write \(n = m_1 \cdot m_2\), with \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) less than \(n\) (and greater than 1). By the inductive hypothesis, \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) are each either prime or can be written as the product of primes. In either case, we have that \(n\) is written as the product of primes.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2711}{}%
Thus by the strong induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \ge 2\).%
\end{proof}
\end{example}
\hypertarget{p-2712}{}%
Whether you use regular induction or strong induction depends on the statement you want to prove. If you wanted to be safe, you could always use strong induction. It really is \emph{stronger}, so can accomplish everything ``weak'' induction can. That said, using regular induction is often easier since there is only one place you can use the induction hypothesis. There is also something to be said for \emph{elegance} in proofs. If you can prove a statement using simpler tools, it is nice to do so.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2713}{}%
As a final contrast between the two forms of induction, consider once more the stamp problem. Regular induction worked by showing how to increase postage by one cent (either replacing three 5-cent stamps with two 8-cent stamps, or three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent stamps). We could give a slightly different proof using strong induction. First, we could show \emph{five} base cases: it is possible to make 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32 cents (we would actually say how each of these is made). Now assume that it is possible to make \(k\) cents of postage for all \(k \lt  n\) as long as \(k \ge 28\). As long as \(n > 32\), this means in particular we can make \(k = n-5\) cents. Now add a 5-cent stamp to get make \(n\) cents.%

Let \(P(n)\) be the statement that \(n + 3 = n + 7\). We will prove that \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \in \N\). Assume, for induction that \(P(k)\) is true. That is, \(k+3 = k+7\). We must show that \(P(k+1)\) is true. Now since \(k + 3 = k + 7\), add 1 to both sides. This gives \(k + 3 + 1 = k + 7 + 1\). Regrouping \((k+1) + 3 = (k+1) + 7\). But this is simply \(P(k+1)\).

\hypertarget{p-2763}{}%
Let \(P(n)\) be the statement \(n \lt  100\). We will prove \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \in \N\). First we establish the base case: when \(n = 0\), \(P(n)\) is true, because \(0 \lt  100\). Now for the inductive step, assume \(P(k)\) is true. That is, \(k \lt  100\). Now if \(k \lt  100\), then \(k\) is some number, like 80. Of course \(80+1 = 81\) which is still less than 100. So \(k +1 \lt  100\) as well. But this is what \(P(k+1)\) claims, so we have shown that \(P(k) \imp P(k+1)\). Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \in \N\).%

Let \(P(n)\) be the statement ``\(n^2 + n\) is odd.'' We will prove that \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \in \N\). Suppose for induction that \(P(k)\) is true, that is, that \(k^2 + k\) is odd. Now consider the statement \(P(k+1)\). Now \((k+1)^2 + (k+1) = k^2 + 2k + 1 + k + 1 = k^2 + k + 2k + 2\). By the inductive hypothesis, \(k^2 + k\) is odd, and of course \(2k + 2\) is even. An odd plus an even is always odd, so therefore \((k+1)^2 + (k+1)\) is odd. Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all \(n \in \N\).%

\hypertarget{p-169}{}%
You might think about the relationship between a function being continuous and being differentiable.  Or a shape being a square or a rectangle.%

Add something to your graph so you can ``finish'' the Euler path.  Don't forget to consider the case that the start and end vertex are already adjacent.%

\hypertarget{a-15.b}{}\item[\textbf{\hyperref[task-14]{15.b.}}]
\hypertarget{p-187}{}%
If there are no odd degree vertices, you are done.  If there are two, you could connect them with an edge, except maybe they are already adjacent.  What could you do then?%

\hypertarget{a-23.a}{}\item[\textbf{\hyperref[task-28]{23.a.}}]
\hypertarget{p-258}{}%
Look at paths in the tree.  Let \(v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_n\) be a path of maximal length.  What can you say about \(v_0\) and \(v_n\)?%

\hypertarget{a-23.b}{}\item[\textbf{\hyperref[task-29]{23.b.}}]
\hypertarget{p-260}{}%
What is the smallest number of vertices that make sense?  You will need to prove that \emph{all} trees with one vertex have the correct number of edges.  This should be very easy.%

\hypertarget{a-23.c}{}\item[\textbf{\hyperref[task-30]{23.c.}}]
\hypertarget{p-262}{}%
To get to a tree with \(n-1\) vertices, you need to \emph{trim} \(T\) somehow.  Which vertex should you get rid of?  What will this do to the number of edges?%

\hypertarget{a-25}{}\item[\textbf{\hyperref[activity-20]{25.}}]
\hypertarget{p-274}{}%
You can take \(n = e = 1\) as your base case.  For the inductive case, start with an arbitrary graph with \(n\) edges.  Consider two cases: either \(G\) contains a cycle or it does not.%

If you assume \(P\) and conclude \(Q\), but \(Q\) is true, can you say anything about \(P\)?  What row(s) of the truth table for \(P \imp Q\) are you in?%

You will want to use a proof by induction on the number of vertices.  Use the fact that every planar graph has at least one vertex of degree at most 5.%

\hypertarget{p-442}{}%
Often when there is a counter-example, there is one with a good deal of symmetry. (Caution: there is a difference between often and always!) One way to help yourself get a symmetric example, if there is one, is to put 8 vertices into a circle. Then, perhaps, you might draw green edges in some sort of regular fashion until it is impossible to draw another green edge between any two of the vertices without creating a green triangle.%

\hypertarget{a-51}{}\item[\textbf{\hyperref[activity-44]{51.}}]

All that is left is to decide what can happen with \(K_9\).  First explain why no matter how the edges are colored red and blue, there is at least one vertex incident to an even number of red edges and an even number of blue edges.  What could this even number of red edges be?%

\hypertarget{a-52}{}\item[\textbf{\hyperref[Ramseyrecurrence]{52.}}]

What you need to show is that if there are \(R(m - 1, n) + R(m, n - 1)\) people in a room, then there are either \(m\) mutual acquaintances or \(n\) mutual strangers. As with earlier problems, it helps to start with a person and think about the number of people with whom this person is acquainted or nonacquainted. The generalized pigeonhole principle tells you something about these numbers.%

\hypertarget{a-53.b}{}\item[\textbf{\hyperref[task-62]{53.b.}}]
\hypertarget{p-453}{}%
If you could find four mutual acquaintances, you could assume person 1 is among them. And by the generalized pigeonhole principle and symmetry, so are two of the people to the first, second, fourth and eighth to the right. Now there are lots of possibilities for that fourth person. You now have the hard work of using symmetry and the definition of who is acquainted with whom to eliminate all possible combinations of four people. Then you have to think about non-acquaintances.%

\hypertarget{a-60.c}{}\item[\textbf{\hyperref[task-68]{60.c.}}]
\hypertarget{p-484}{}%

\hypertarget{p-487}{}%
Take \(A\) to be the 13 piles and \(B\) to be the 13 values.  What would the matching condition need to say, and why is it satisfied.%

\hypertarget{a-68.c}{}\item[\textbf{\hyperref[task-93]{68.c.}}]
\hypertarget{p-538}{}%
This is a little harder.  It might help to notice that there is really nothing special about \([n]\) except that it contains \(n\) elements.  In fact, what can you say about the number of \(k\)-element subsets of \emph{any} \(n\)-element set?  Then, what \(n\)-element set would we look at when expanding \((x+y)^n\)?%

\hypertarget{a-72}{}\item[\textbf{\hyperref[activity-65]{72.}}]
\hypertarget{p-581}{}%
This should be really easy; don't let that fool you.  Note that a correct proof must start with one side of the identity and manipulate it into the other side.  The following is NOT a correct proof, because it starts by assuming the statement you wish to prove.%
\begin{align*}
\binom{n}{k}  = \amp \binom{n}{n-k}\\
\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} =  \amp \frac{n!}{(n-k)!(n-(n-k)!)}\\
\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} =  \amp \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!)}\\
\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \cdot (k!(n-k)!)=  \amp \frac{n!}{(n-k)!(n-(n-k)!)}\cdot(k!(n-k)!)\\
n! =  \amp n!

%

\hypertarget{a-73}{}\item[\textbf{\hyperref[activity-66]{73.}}]
\hypertarget{p-585}{}%
You will probably want to use the Pascal recurrence \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}\).  Note that once you pick your \(n\), you should argue that the identity holds for all \(0 \le k \le n\).  You should not do double induction.%

\hypertarget{p-603}{}%
Recall the bijection principle tells us that if \(f:X \to Y\) is a bijection, then \(\card{X} = \card{Y}\).  What is the cardinality of each of the subsets of \(\pow([n])\) that we are considering?%

\hypertarget{a-76}{}\item[\textbf{\hyperref[act-pascalrowsum-alg]{76.}}]

We say ``should'', but please don't waste your time doing this all the way out.  Unless you are really bored.%

\hypertarget{a-77}{}\item[\textbf{\hyperref[activity-70]{77.}}]
\hypertarget{p-611}{}%
Again, use the Pascal recurrence \(\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}\).  Doing this for all summands will give you some repeats.%

\hypertarget{a-78.a}{}\item[\textbf{\hyperref[task-112]{78.a.}}]
\hypertarget{p-618}{}%
Your final answer here should be a sum, since we have counted the number of subsets partitioned into disjoint collections.%

\hypertarget{a-78.b}{}\item[\textbf{\hyperref[task-113]{78.b.}}]
\hypertarget{p-621}{}%
Think about how many choices you have for each element.  You could put 1 in the subset or not.  You could include \(2\) in the subset or not.%

\hypertarget{a-79}{}\item[\textbf{\hyperref[act-pascalrowsum-binom]{79.}}]
\hypertarget{p-627}{}%
Just do it.%

\hypertarget{a-85.a}{}\item[\textbf{\hyperref[task-130]{85.a.}}]
\hypertarget{p-666}{}%
Many students want this sort of question to be an example of the sum principle (presumably because to get an acceptable path you travel to \((4,7)\) and then add on a path that gets you the rest of the way.  But notice that you are really concatenating two paths, and there are lots of choices for the first path and lots for the second.  This sounds more like an ordered pair.%

The point of this question is to push back against your conception of what ``order matters'' means.  Since you know the answers must be \(\binom{9}{5}\) or \(P(9,5)\), you should be able to answer correctly by deciding which set is bigger.%

Why is \(\gamma_i\) odd? Now partition \(k\) into \(2^{k_1}\) parts of size \(\gamma_1\), \(2^{k_2}\) parts of size \(\gamma_2\), etc. and you have a partition of \(k\) into odd parts.%

Suppose we have a partition of \(k\) into distinct parts. If the smallest part, say \(m\), is smaller than the number of parts, we may add one to each of the \(m\) largest parts and delete the smallest part, and we have changed the parity of the number of parts, but we still have distinct parts. On the other hand, suppose the smallest part, again say \(m\), is larger than or equal to the number of parts. Then we can subtract 1 from each part larger than \(m\), and add a part equal to the number of parts larger than \(m\). This changes the parity of the number of parts, but if the second smallest part is \(m+1\), the resulting partition does not have distinct parts. Thus this method does not work. Further, if it did always work, the case \(k \ne \frac{3j^2+j}{2}\) would be covered also. However you can modify this method by comparing \(m\) not to the total number of parts, but to the number of rows at the top of the Young diagram that differ by exactly one from the row above. Even in this situation, there are certain slight additional assumptions you need to make, so this hint leaves you a lot of work to do. (It is reasonable to expect problems because of that exceptional case.) However, it should lead you in a useful direction.%

\paragraph[{4. MODIFICATIONS}]{4. MODIFICATIONS}\hypertarget{gfdl-section4}{}
\hypertarget{p-2820}{}%
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:\leavevmode%
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item\hypertarget{li-562}{}\hypertarget{p-2821}{}%
Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.%
\item\hypertarget{li-563}{}\hypertarget{p-2822}{}%
List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.%
\item\hypertarget{li-564}{}\hypertarget{p-2823}{}%
State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.%
\item\hypertarget{li-565}{}\hypertarget{p-2824}{}%
Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.%
\item\hypertarget{li-566}{}\hypertarget{p-2825}{}%
Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.%
\item\hypertarget{li-567}{}\hypertarget{p-2826}{}%
Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.%
\item\hypertarget{li-568}{}\hypertarget{p-2827}{}%
Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.%
\item\hypertarget{li-569}{}\hypertarget{p-2828}{}%
Include an unaltered copy of this License.%
\item\hypertarget{li-570}{}\hypertarget{p-2829}{}%
Preserve the section Entitled ``History'', Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled ``History'' in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.%
\item\hypertarget{li-571}{}\hypertarget{p-2830}{}%
Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the ``History'' section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.%
\item\hypertarget{li-572}{}\hypertarget{p-2831}{}%
For any section Entitled ``Acknowledgements'' or ``Dedications'', Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.%
\item\hypertarget{li-573}{}\hypertarget{p-2832}{}%
Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.%
\item\hypertarget{li-574}{}\hypertarget{p-2833}{}%
Delete any section Entitled ``Endorsements''. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.%
\item\hypertarget{li-575}{}\hypertarget{p-2834}{}%
Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled ``Endorsements'' or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.%
\item\hypertarget{li-576}{}\hypertarget{p-2835}{}%
Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.%
\end{enumerate}
%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2836}{}%
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2837}{}%
You may add a section Entitled ``Endorsements'', provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties \textemdash{} for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2838}{}%
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2839}{}%
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Paragraphs  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS}
\typeout{************************************************}
\paragraph[{5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS}]{5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS}\hypertarget{gfdl-section5}{}
\hypertarget{p-2840}{}%
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2841}{}%
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2842}{}%
In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled ``History'' in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled ``History''; likewise combine any sections Entitled ``Acknowledgements'', and any sections Entitled ``Dedications''. You must delete all sections Entitled ``Endorsements''.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Paragraphs  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS}
\typeout{************************************************}
\paragraph[{6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS}]{6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS}\hypertarget{gfdl-section6}{}
\hypertarget{p-2843}{}%
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2844}{}%
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Paragraphs  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS}
\typeout{************************************************}
\paragraph[{7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS}]{7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS}\hypertarget{gfdl-section7}{}
\hypertarget{p-2845}{}%
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an ``aggregate'' if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2846}{}%
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Paragraphs  8. TRANSLATION}
\typeout{************************************************}
\paragraph[{8. TRANSLATION}]{8. TRANSLATION}\hypertarget{gfdl-section8}{}
\hypertarget{p-2847}{}%
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2848}{}%
If a section in the Document is Entitled ``Acknowledgements'', ``Dedications'', or ``History'', the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Paragraphs  9. TERMINATION}
\typeout{************************************************}
\paragraph[{9. TERMINATION}]{9. TERMINATION}\hypertarget{gfdl-section9}{}
\hypertarget{p-2849}{}%
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2850}{}%
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2851}{}%
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2852}{}%
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Paragraphs  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE}
\typeout{************************************************}
\paragraph[{10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE}]{10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE}\hypertarget{gfdl-section10}{}
\hypertarget{p-2853}{}%
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See \url{http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/}.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2854}{}%
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License ``or any later version'' applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.%
\typeout{************************************************}
\typeout{Paragraphs  11. RELICENSING}
\typeout{************************************************}
\paragraph[{11. RELICENSING}]{11. RELICENSING}\hypertarget{gfdl-section11}{}
\hypertarget{p-2855}{}%
``Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site'' (or ``MMC Site'') means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A ``Massive Multiauthor Collaboration'' (or ``MMC'') contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2856}{}%
``CC-BY-SA'' means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2857}{}%
``Incorporate'' means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2858}{}%
An MMC is ``eligible for relicensing'' if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.%
\par
\hypertarget{p-2859}{}%
The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.%
